The suspected shooter, who used at least one handgun, was identified as 24-year-old David Katz from Baltimore, Maryland. Katz was a participant in the video game tournament and reportedly became angry when he was defeated, according to witnesses. The shooting occured at a game bar hosting a Madden 19 NFL video game tournament at The Landing entertainment and shopping complex. About a dozen gun shots could be heard on livestream footage of the popular American football video game before being cut off. In one scene, what appears to be a laser from a gun passes over the body of one of the video game players. Josh Benson, an anchor with News Channel 8 in Tampa, shared a video of Katz doing an interview after a previous Madden win. In 2017. Katz had won the Madden 17 for the Buffalo Bills. The NFL team posted a picture of Katz on its Twitter last year. Electronic Arts, the company that makes the video game, said: "This is a horrible situation, and our deepest sympathies go out to all involved." The winner of the tournament takes home $5,000 (€4,293) and qualifies for the national tournament sponsored by Electronic Arts. cw/bw (dpa, AFP, Reuters)
