An earthquake measuring 7.0 struck off the coast of the Indonesian island of Lombok on Sunday. After initially issuing a tsunami warning in response to the quake, Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency withdrew the alert. Shortly after the quake, Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of the Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics, warned during a TV interview that residents should move inland. "Please go to a place with higher ground, while remaining calm and not panicking," she told viewers. In Mataram, Lombok's main city, residents described a strong jolt that sent people fleeing out of buildings. "Everyone immediately ran out of their homes, everyone is panicking," Iman, a resident of Mataram, told AFP news agency. Danger in paradise The US Geological Survey said the earthquake struck 10 kilometers (6 miles) underground. A least 14 aftershocks had been recorded since the initial rumble. The quake comes a week after a 6.4 quake killed 17 people on the island, which is just east of Bali. Parts of Bali also felt the earth shake,  according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokeman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman.
