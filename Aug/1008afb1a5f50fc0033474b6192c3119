South Korea's Transport Minister Kim Hyun-mee said in a statement on Friday that a government probe would "investigate the fires of BMW vehicles thoroughly and transparently." The probe will examine whether the company had "reacted appropriately" to 28 incidents of BMW cars catching fire in the Asian country this year, the minister said. "If any problems are found, we will take stern measures," Kim added. If the probe finds that the recall was delayed, BMW could be forced to pay a fine of up to 70 billion won ($62 million, €51 million) under South Korean law.
