More than 1,000 people were arrested across Brazil on Friday in a major police operation that authorities said focused on murders and violence against women. About 6,600 police officers participated in "Operation Cronos" across 16 states, leading to the arrest of 157 men for crimes against women, according to the Public Security Ministry. Fourteen of those arrests were for femicide, or the killing of females because of their gender. "What matters to us is the protection and guarantee of life, above all to combat femicide, that cowardly and unacceptable crime," said Public Security Minister Raul Jungmann.  "Some crimes are more serious and repugnant, especially those against women." Among the 1,027 arrests, 225 were for homicide, 224 on drug trafficking charges and another 421 for "diverse offenses." Seventy five minors were also taken into custody. Planning for the operation had been in the works since July. Jungmann said authorities planned to carry out similar nation-wide operations targeting criminals and men who engage in violence against women.
