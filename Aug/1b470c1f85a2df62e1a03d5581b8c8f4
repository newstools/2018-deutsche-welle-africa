The White House announced on Wednesday that it was imposing sanctions on two top members of the Turkish government over a US pastor who is being held for spying and terror-related charges. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that Turkey's Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul (above right) and Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu (above left) were being targeted for their role in the detention of 50-year-old Andrew Craig Brunson. "We believe he's a victim of unfair and unjust attention by the government of Turkey," Sanders said of Brunson. Andrew Craig Brunson, originally from North Carolina, was released from jail but is confined to house arrest in Turkey Brunson faces 35 years The US pastor was first arrested in October 2016, when Turkey was in the immediate throes of a failed coup attempt crackdown. He is accused of supporting the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara, and exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen. If convicted, he faces 35 years in prison. Last week, Brunson was allowed to leave prison and remain under house arrest, but his request to leave Turkey was denied.
