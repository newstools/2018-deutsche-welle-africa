At least four people, including two police officers, were killed in a shooting incident in the eastern Canadian city of Fredericton in New Brunswick. Several other victims were being treated at a regional hospital. The Fredericton police said in a post on Twitter they had taken one suspect in custody. The suspect is currently being treated for serious injuries. The circumstances of the shooting are unclear at this point. "Awful news coming out of Fredericton," Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter. "My heart goes out to everyone affected by this morning’s shooting. We’re following the situation closely." Fredericton residents said they heard as many as 20 gunshots that prompted police to initially cordon off a large section of the city with emergency vehicles. "This is the first time I've even heard of any serious crime or violent crime in this city," said Travis Hrubeniuk, whose fiancee had just left their home when the sirens began. Rise in gun crimes Gun crimes have increased in Canada, where gun laws are stricter than they are in the United States, in recent years mainly due to a proliferation of weapons. Toronto, Canada's largest city, has witnessed 241 shooting incidents this year, resulting in 30 deaths. Last month, a gunman walked down a busy Toronto street, killing two people and wounding 13 others before dying in an exchange of gunfire with police. ap/rc (AP, Reuters, AFP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
