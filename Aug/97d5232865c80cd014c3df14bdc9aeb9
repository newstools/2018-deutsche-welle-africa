The EU's Security Commission is working on a legislative proposal to be presented in September to make internet companies such as Facebook and Google identify terrorist content on their platforms and delete it immediately. EU Security Commissioner Julian King told Germany's Die Welt newspaper on Thursday: "Despite the positive results from previous voluntary agreements, we have not seen enough progress, and in order to better protect our citizens, we must now take stronger action on terrorist content." Julian King, Commissioner for Security The aim was "to create a clear, transparent framework and minimum requirements for every internet platform that wants to offer its services to Europeans," King told the newspaper. In a response to DW's query on the subject, the Commission wrote: "The work on the proposal is currently ongoing and we cannot pre-empt the details at this stage."
