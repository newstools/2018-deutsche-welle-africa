Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter Tuesday he was considering having the firm purchase all outstanding shares and return the maker of electric cars to a privately held company. He indicated there wouldn't be any funding issue involved in the move. It was not clear immediately if Musk was serious, with the CEO having a history of just-for-fun and erratic tweets. Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Happy investors Nevertheless, the company's shares were up 6.5 percent at $363.46 shortly after the announcement. Tesla has a market value of $58 billion (â‚¬50 billion) as of Monday's close, and Musk himself owns nearly 20 percent of the company. A deal of $420 per share would represent a 22.8 percent premium on Tesla's closing price on Monday, valuing the firm at about $72 billion. Separately on Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had built a minority stake below the 5 percent threshold requiring public disclosure.
