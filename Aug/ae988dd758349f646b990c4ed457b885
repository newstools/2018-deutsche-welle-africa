Eight places in Portugal broke local temperature records, with the high peaking at 47 Celsius (116.6 Fahrenheit) in some places. Officials predicted scorching temperatures could rise a further 2 or 3 degrees Celsius on Sunday, pushing them above Europe's previous record high of 48 degrees Celsius, recorded in Athens in 1977. A large part of Portugal has been placed on high alert by the country's Civil Protection Agency as hundreds of firefighters battle a wildfire in the southern Algarve region. In Spain, authorities issued heat warnings for 41 of the country's 50 provinces as temperatures reached up to 44 degrees. In northern Europe, Sweden has warned of "a high risk" of wildfires in central and southern Sweden this weekend because of the continuing dry weather and strong winds.
