Critics lauded his ability to perfect even simple dishes such as mashed potatoes and developing the "Atelier" (workshop in French) restaurant model, where diners observed chefs while they cooked their dishes. Robuchon was born to a bricklaying father in Poitiers in western France in 1945 and began training as a chef at age 15. He was named head chef at the Parisian Hotel Concorde La Fayette at the age of 29 and went on to open acclaimed restaurants in more than three continents during the 1980s and 90s.
