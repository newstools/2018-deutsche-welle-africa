At least eight people were swept away when raging water tore through the Raganello Gorge in Italy's southern Calabria region on Monday, officials said. "We have eight dead but we can't rule out the toll increasing," the local civil protection unit told the AFP news agency. All of the victims are believed to be Italian tourists. Three groups of hikers were said to be in the creek when a heavy downpour caused water levels to rise suddenly.

"This is a split in the terrain that is very tight and high. Imagine nearly a kilometer (half a mile) in height. And just a few meters (yards) wide." Tansi said about a dozen people, including a 10-year-old boy, were brought to safety. Six of the rescued group were injured.
