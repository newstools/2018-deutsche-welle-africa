The president of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Holger Münch, had reason to be pleased when he presented his agency's report on organized crime in 2017 in Germany. At a press conference in Wiesbaden on Wednesday, Münch said that the economic damage resulting from organized plummeted from around 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion) in 2016 to 209 million ($244 million). Part of that dramatic fall is due to the fact that 2016 was a statistical outlier. But economic damage from organized crime has been consistently falling in recent years and is now well under a third of what it was in 2013. The figures suggest that while the number of organized crimes remains steady, criminals could be making less and less money from them. "The conspicuous decrease in the damage amount comes from the fact that conspicuously fewer cases of organized crime involving large sums were reported," the BKA wrote. "For example in 2017, only three cases involving damage of more than 10 million euros were reported from areas normally involving high sums like property, tax and customs and economic crimes." In total only twelve cases of organized crimes with a value of more than 10 million euros were recorded. Such numbers suggest that Germany is bucking the global trend which has seen organized crime booming. More to come...
