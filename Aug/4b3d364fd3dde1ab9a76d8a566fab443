Depardieu is one of France's best known actors and one of its most recognizable faces abroad. He gained international fame in the 1990s, including his roles in Ridley Scott's "1492: Conquest of Paradise," and "The Man in the Iron Mask" where he played alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, and John Malkovich. He is also known in Europe as the comic-book hero Obelix in Asterix & Obelix live action films.

According to unnamed judicial sources, the 22-year-old dancer and actress claims Depardieu assaulted her on August 7 and August 13 at his home in Paris. She filed her complaint in the southern city of Aix-en-Provence, prompting the police to look into the incident. "I regret the public nature of this process which poses a major prejudice to Gerard Depardieu, whose innocence I am convinced will be recognized," Temime said on Thursday. dj/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa, AP)
