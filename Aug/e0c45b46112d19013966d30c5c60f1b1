Spanish police on Wednesday arrested 85-year-old Manuel Charlin, long considered one of Spain's most notorious drug lords. Charlin was captured during a raid against a major cocaine trafficking operation in Spain's northwestern region of Galicia. At least 18 other people were arrested, including Melchor Charlin,Â Manuel's son. Authorities said the operation centered on a major cocaine haul off the Azores islands, an autonomous Portuguese archipelago, headed for Galicia. 'Most violent organization' Charlin became infamous for his violent manner while leading the Charlin clan, one of Europe's largest drug trafficking networks from Galicia. His clan was described as "without a doubt the most violent organization" in the region by investigative reporter Nacho Carretero. Charlin's arrest comes months after Spanish police detained another well-known drug trafficker, 62-year-old Sito Minanco. Read more: Colombia's cocaine: Who will take charge now?
