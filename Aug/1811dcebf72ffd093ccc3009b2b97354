Despite battling rainy conditions at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps on Saturday, Lewis Hamilton earned pole position for Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix. Rain came down for the third and final part of qualifying, known as Q3, setting up a spectacular final lap for Hamilton. His last effort beat German driver Sebastian Vettel's time by 0.7 seconds. "The rain is always a friend of mine," the Briton said. "I think that was one of the hardest sessions I can remember. We only had a few laps to find the grip, to find where the track was dry and wet." It is the fifth pole for the Mercedes driver this season and his record-extending 78th. Hamilton holds a 24-point lead over Ferrari's Vettel in the F1 drivers' standings after he won the last two races before F1's four-week break.
