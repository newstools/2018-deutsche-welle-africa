Alaska Airlines confirmed there was an "unauthorized take-off" of a Horizon Air plane from Sea-Tac airport around 9.50 p.m Friday evening (04:50 Saturday UTC). The aircraft crashed on Ketron Island in Puget Sound. Two military F-15s were scrambled to pursue the plane, but were not involved in the crash. Normal operations at Sea-Tac Airport have resumed. Preliminary information suggested that a mechanic had stolen the aircraft and the crash may have been caused by the mechanic "doing stunts in air or lack of flying skills," according to the local sheriff's office. Sheriff Paul Pastor said on Twitter it was not a terrorist incident. The plane was stolen by a local 29-year-old "suicidal male" who acted alone and was likely killed in the crash. His identity is known but has not been released. The FBI's Seattle field office said on Twitter it was working with local, state and federal partners, but it was "too early for us to put out details on the evolving situation." "The sky was filled with fighter jets, you could hear it," local resident Jeff Duncan told DW. He said he thought it was some military drills from the nearby McCord Airbase. Unverified video footage on social media showed a large plane flying above the Seattle area with an F-15 following it.
