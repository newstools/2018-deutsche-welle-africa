A court in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh has sentenced two men to death for raping an 8-year-old girl in the city of Mandsaur. The investigation and trial of the gruesome case, which sparked angry protests, was completed in less than two months, a welcome change in a country where court cases can drag on for years. The sentence is one of the first ordered under a new law allowing for speedy investigations and trials in rape cases and death penalties for child rapists. The two convicts, aged 20 and 24, lured the class 2 student from outside her school as she waited for her father. They took her to a secluded spot and gang-raped her. The two slashed her neck and left her to die. The victim is still recovering in hospital.
