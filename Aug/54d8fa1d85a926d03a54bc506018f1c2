Kerber was the second of three German players slated for the Louis Armstrong Stadium on day 2 of the Open and, after watching compatriot Andrea Petkovic fall to 2017 French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko, she strode to the baseline with the mercury touching 35 degrees. The reigning Wimbledon champion started well, registering an early break before allowing Gasparyan to break break shortly after. The Russian, ranked 370 in the world thanks largely to injury, clung on to take the opener to a tie break but Kerber's big match experience showed as she took it out 7-5. As fans and player alike seemd to wilt in the heat and humidity, Kerber stepped up a gear to take the second set 6-3 and set up a clash with Sweden's Johanna Larsson for a place in the last 32.  "It was not easy today, it was so hot," said Kerber in a courtside interview after the win. "I'm happy to get through, I just wanted to play point by point and not think too much. Despite the conditions it was good match and both of us were at a high level. " The heat was so brutal on Tuesday afternoon at Flushing Meadows that tournament officials added a 10-minute break between the third and fourth set of the men's best-of-five singles matches. Players will be allowed to leave the court during the break, but can't seek medical treatment, the tournament said in an announcement. That ruling will affect Alexander Zverev, the last of the German trio in action on Tuesday. He faces Peter Polansky of Canada. mp (DPA, AP)
