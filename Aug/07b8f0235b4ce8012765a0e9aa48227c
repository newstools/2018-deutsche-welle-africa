But he knows strong rains could trigger another, and that he might not be so lucky next time. He's one of many farmers in this part of Nepal coming up against the effects of soil-destroying pesticides and the slash-and-burn agriculture that has increased the danger of landslides. Now, Neupane and other farmers are getting advice on how to protect themselves against torrents of mud and stone — and how they can revitalize their farms — from an usual source: puppets.
