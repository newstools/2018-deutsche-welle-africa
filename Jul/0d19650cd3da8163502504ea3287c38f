Parisian holidaymakers were left stranded on Friday after a fire shut down Montparnasse train station. Smoke billowed out of a substation run by the national transport network in Issy-les-Moulineaux, leading to the evacuation of 2,500 people and a power cut for 16,000 homes, authorities said. It also shut down rail traffic at the station, which is a major link to west and southwest France, affecting about 100,000 travelers, according to rail operator SNCF.
