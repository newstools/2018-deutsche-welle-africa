In 2016, a group of youths attempted to set a sleeping homeless man on fire in Berlin's Schönleinstraße subway station. People getting off a train were able to put out the fire and prevent it from spreading. The main suspect and group ringleader was sentenced to two years and nine months in prison. Three others in the group were convicted as juveniles and were given eight-month suspended sentences, while another three group members were ordered to spend several weeks in a youth detention center for not helping the man. There are between 4,000 to 10,000 homeless people in Berlin. Aid organizations estimate that some 860,000 people across Germany are without a home. rs/rc (dpa, AFP, AP, epd) Send  Facebook   Twitter   google+   Whatsapp   Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/2qGPg
