The UAE intervened in the Yemeni conflict in 2015 and has developed the Security Belt and Elite Forces, a militia based in southern Yemen which is officially under the control of Yemen's interior ministry. According to the Associated Press, the Security Belt is responsible for the Beir Ahmed prison in Aden where there have been reports of extensive human rights violations. jm/rc (Reuters, AP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
