A New Zealand trust company on Wednesday announced it was permanently changing to a four-day working week after a successful trial period earlier this year. "Productivity went marginally up, stress levels dropped," Andrew Barnes, the chief executive at Perpetual Guardian told New Zealand's AM Show on Wednesday. The eight-week trial started on March 5 this year and saw the company's entire staff – some 240 people – offered a free day off every week with no changes to their remuneration or working conditions.

Before the trial, 54 percent of Perpetual Trust employees were happy with their work-life balance, and this increased to 78 percent with the four-day working week in place.
