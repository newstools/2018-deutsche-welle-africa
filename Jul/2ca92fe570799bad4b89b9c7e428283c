The city of Dusseldorf opened Germany's biggest skate park on Saturday after more than a decade in the making. The skate park in the city's Eller district opened to a large number of visitors, including those who were not interested in skating and had come to enjoy other services at the park, such as a bowling center. The 1,600 square meter skating area provides ample space to both learners and advanced skaters. City officials, which conceived the idea to build a large skating park in 2005, said it cost them 1.8 million euros to construct this facility. The park has the potential to host major skating events such as a German championship or Olympics qualification games, local officials said.
