Sitting in fourth after his first two efforts, Hamilton produced a brilliant final lap and will lead an all-Mercedes front row, after teammate Valtteri Bottas recorded the second quickest time. The two Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel occupy the second row. Hamilton leads Vettel by 17 points after he came from 14th on the grid to win last weekend's German Grand Prix. "We couldn't have expected this... the Ferraris were quicker all weekend, but the heavens opened and it was fair game," said Hamilton afterwards. "It's so tricky out there, at the beginning it was dry and then it got wetter so it was hard to say how much grip we had. "When it was drier it was a bit like doing ballet and tiptoeing trying to find a line. It was give and take all the way around. We've got a great position so we're going to do our best as a team and keep the red guys behind us."
