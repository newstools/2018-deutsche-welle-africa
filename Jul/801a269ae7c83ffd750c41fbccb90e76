Thousands of revelers donning rainbow colors thronged central London on Saturday to take part in the British capital's pride celebrations. Among the participants was London Mayor Sadiq Khan. "Here in London, you are free to be whoever you want to be, and love whoever you want to love," he wrote on Twitter. The event, first held in 1972, champions equality, diversity and greater rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. An estimated 1 million spectators lined the streets to watch the massive parade — involving some 30,000 people from more than 470 organizations — make its way from Regent Street to Trafalgar Square. Pride director Christopher Joell-Deshields said this year's festival was more diverse than ever. "People are able to just come and be who they are and celebrate whatever they want," he said.
