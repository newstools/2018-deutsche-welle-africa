Two policemen were shot dead by unknown gunmen in Dagestan, part of Russia's volatile Caucasus, local police said Saturday. Driving a Russian-made Lada, the attackers opened fire on a police car Friday night, killing two of the three traffic officers inside.

The gunmen fled after the shooting, which occurred in the town of Kizilyurt. It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack but police said they're searching for the gunmen.
