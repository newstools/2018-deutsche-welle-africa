Three-time World Champion Peter Sagan was the winner of the second stage of the Tour de France, finishing the flat 182.5km leg in four hours and six minutes. The Bora-Hansgrohe rider took the stage after a reduced sprint finish, beating Italian Sonny Colbrelli and France's Arnaud Demare, who finished second and third respectively. This was the Slovak's ninth Tour stage win. "It's a good start, I'm really back,” said Sagan after the race. "It's a perfect day. I was a bit scared because Sonny was coming back strong.” The World Champion has managed to avoid a high-speed crash involving previous yellow jersey wearer, Colombia's Fernando Gaviria, and a host of other riders. Germany's Marcel Kittel, that previously won 14 Tour stages, could not make it back to the front of the peloton after suffering from a puncture just eight kilometers from the finish line. The next stage will be a 35km-long team time trial, and will take place tomorrow in Cholet. ftm/mds (Reuters, AFP, AP)
