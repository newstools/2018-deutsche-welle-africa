A Ryanair flight from Dublin to the Croatian city of Zadar had to make an emergency landing at Frankfurt-Hahn airport in western Germany due to technical problems on Friday, German police said. Flight FR7312 landed at Frankfurt-Hahn airport in the small municipality of Hahn at around 11:30 p.m. Friday evening, a spokesman for the Federal Police told DW. "There was a technical problem and the air pressure went down, so the pilot had to take the aircraft down in Hahn," the spokesman said, adding that the exact cause of the emergency landing was unclear. One passenger on the plane posted a photograph of the plane's oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling. Read more: Up in the air?

The passenger said no further information had been given about the passengers who were taken to the hospital, one of which was her boyfriend, and she had been unable to contact Ryanair. "If the flight goes without him back, they didn't give me any alternative flight and I have no information. No number to call, no one to speak with. Just the people from the airport who are trying their best to help us," she tweeted.
