At least 10 people were injured in the northern German city of Lübeck on Friday in an apparent knife attack on a bus, according to state police in Schleswig-Holstein. The police also confirmed that they had dispatched a "large deployment" to the scene of the crime. The Lübecker Nachrichten newspaper wrote that two of those wounded were in serious condition. Witnesses told the paper that the attack happened in the Kücknitz neighborhood on a public bus, en route to the North Sea beach area of Travemünde. The assailant let his backpack fall and then took out his weapon. The driver stopped the bus and was then struck by the suspect. The passengers then reportedly restrained him. A second witness who lives on the street where the bus was driving said that the man was armed with a kitchen knife. Police: No reason to suspect terrorism The area around the bus was cordoned off throughout Friday afternoon. Authorities have not yet confirmed the suspect's motive, but police have said that "there is no evidence of political radicalization" and no reason to believe the attack had a "terrorist background." Police clarified that the suspect is a 34-year-old German citizen who was born in Iran but had lived in Germany for a long time. As of Friday evening, he had not confessed to any wrongdoing. State prosecutors said they are working quickly to bring charges of attempted arson and grevious bodily harm.
