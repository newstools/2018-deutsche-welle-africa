Mexicans are lining up to vote for a new president in an election that is expected to hand over power to an anti-establishment outsider. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor, has maintained a commanding lead in opinion polls throughout a campaign marred by more than 100 murders of politicians by suspected drug gangs.

His rivals Ricardo Anaya and Antonio Meade both said they were expecting to be celebrating when polls close later Sunday. Pena Nieto told reporters at the polling station that his administration would be "absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected." Juan Carlos Limas, who cast his vote at another Mexico City polling station to vote for Ricardo Anaya, said he was worried by some of Obrador's promises, including a "transformation" of Mexico and scholarships or paid apprenticeships to youth, and increase support payments for the elderly. "I am concerned that some candidates are making proposals that are impossible, because they're very expensive to carry out," said the 26-year-old. Sharp-tongued politician It's the third shot at the presidency for 64-year-old Lopez Obrador, who finished runner-up in the 2006 and 2012 elections. The sharp-tongued politician has tapped voters' anger against a political class whose credibility has been hit by widespread corruption, soaring crime levels and years of modest economic growth. Rivals warn that Lopez Obrador's interventionist economic policy could set the country back decades. ap/ng (AP, Reuters, dpa, AFP)
