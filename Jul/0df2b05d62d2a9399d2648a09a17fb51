Egypt's president warned a youth conference in Cairo on Sunday about taking part in an internet craze known as the 'Kiki challenge' which involves people getting out of a slow-moving car and leaving the door open as they dance alongside in sync to the hit song "In My Feelings" by Canadian rapper Drake. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi light-heartedly berated young Egyptians for taking part. "You keep riding cars and doing the Kiki," he said as he joked about the rising price of gasoline in the Middle East nation. Face the music Last week, Egypt warned that penalties would be imposed "for endangering lives and violating public decency and traffic laws" on people taking part in the challenge. Police in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh also issued a warning to parents about the dangers of the Kiki challenge. American–Haitian Hip Hop DJ Whoo Kid tweeted a video of what the challenge can look like when it goes wrong. Threatened with prison The Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi has threatened to "fine or imprison" people caught taking part in the challenge, the prosecutor's office said. Abu Dhabi last week ordered the arrest of three "famous" social media users for taking part in the viral dance challenge. "Participants in this challenge get out of a moving car and leave the door open and dance on a public road next to the car, which is a danger to them and others on the road," it said in a statement. Those arrested will be investigated "on charges of endangering their lives and the lives of others, and violating public morals using social networking sites to promote practises that are incompatible with the values and traditions of society." Many other videos of film stars, sports celebrities and even animals dancing alongside slow moving cars have gone viral.
