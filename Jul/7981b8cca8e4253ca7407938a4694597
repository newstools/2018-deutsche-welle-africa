US President Donald Trump welcomed economic growth of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, calling it an "amazing rate," and pledged the numbers were sustainable. The figures released on Friday by the US Department of Commerce showed the economy grew at the fastest pace since 2014 during from April to June. Analysts said consumer spending and exporters helped boost the numbers, as Americans spent their Trump-signed tax cuts, and manufacturers who rushed to get their products delivered ahead of retaliatory tariffs.
