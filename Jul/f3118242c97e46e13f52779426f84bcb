Roger Federer's bid to win a ninth Wimbledon men's singles title came to a surprising end on Wednesday as the Swiss top seed was beaten 2-6 6-7(5) 7-5 6-4 13-11 by Kevin Anderson of South Africa. The nail-biting four-hour and 13-minute contest is bound to go down as one of the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament. This was the 32-year-old South African's first win over Federer in five attempts. It was also Federer's earliest departure from Wimbledon since his shock second-round defeat against Sergiy Stakhovsky in 2013. Anderson, the eighth seed, will move on to face either 2016 runner-up Milos Raonic or American ninth seed John Isner on Friday for a place in Sunday's final. Three-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic has reached his eighth semifinal at the All England club. Djokovic clashes with umpire, advances Earlier in the day, three-time champion Novak Djokovic reached his eighth Wimbledon semifinal with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 win over Japan's Kei Nishikori in a stormy Centre Court clash. The Serbian moves on to face either world No. 1 Rafael Nadal or fifth-seeded Juan Martin del Potro. This will be Djokovic's first semifinal at a major since the 2016 French Open when he completed the career Grand Slam. Djokovic prevailed despite picking up two code violations and accusing umpire Carlos Ramos of "double standards." "I think the first warning was unnecessary," said Djokovic, who was sanctioned in the second set for spearing his racket into the court. "It didn't harm the grass. Kei did the same in the fourth set but wasn't warned. The umpire said he didn't see. I don't think it's fair but it is what it is." pfd/ftm (AFP, APE, Reuters)
