German environmental group Nabu has filed a lawsuit with the country's highest constitutional court to try and block construction of a pipeline through the Baltic Sea to deliver Russian gas to Germany. The move against Nord Stream 2, which includes a temporary restraining order, came after an earlier suit was denied by a lower-level court in the northern German city of Greifswald in early June. Nabu said the construction of the 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) pipeline would harm underwater sea life and are unnecessary for meeting German natural gas demand. In May, environmental group ClientEarth submitted a similar legal complaint in Finland over its concerns that Nord Stream 2 could harm Baltic porpoises, seals and birds. Construction work began shortly thereafter.

Access would also give the country a greener form of energy that could help Germany wean itself off coal. But opponents at home and abroad worry it could make Germany overly reliant on Russia at a time of heightened diplomatic tensions. Eastern European countries have also opposed the project because the pipeline bypasses their territory. amp/kms (dpa, AFP, Reuters) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
