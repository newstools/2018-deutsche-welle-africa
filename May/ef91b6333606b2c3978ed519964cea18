But there are too many animals, which has resulted in degradation of 70 percent of grazing land. Certain plant species are dying out, and animals aren't able to find enough quality food, translating into a loss of income for the herders. A grazing land management system aims to reward sustainable use and give the plants a chance to regenerate. A film by Dan Hirschfeld
