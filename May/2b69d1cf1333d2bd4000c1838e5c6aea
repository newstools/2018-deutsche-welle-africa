Ten people suffered minor injuries when an explosion occurred during the lighting of a bonfire at traditional Lag B'Omer celebrations in the Stamford Hill neighborhood in London, Wednesday evening. The cause of the explosion is unknown, though excessive fuel as well as smartphones, thrown onto the pile by ultra-orthodox Jews who oppose their use, may have led to it. Police confirmed the injuries, adding: "No criminal allegations reported. No serious injuries." The custom of lighting bonfires to commemorate the death of second century sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochi at Lag B'OmerÂ has become a tradition over the last century.
