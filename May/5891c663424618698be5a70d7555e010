Around 100 war veterans rallied with other citizens in downtown Sarajevo on Friday over the recent arrest of Bosniak wartime commander and top army general Atif Dudakovic. The popular military leader is suspected of committing atrocities in the closing months of the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The protesters carried a large banner reading "Heroes, not criminals!" in reference to Dudakovic and 12 other members of the Bosnian army's 5th Corps, who were briefly detained alongside him last week. "Heroes, not criminals" the banners said Regional politican Muharem Fiso, the minister for veteran affairs of the Sarajevo Canton, told the crowd that the Bosniak army was not "criminal" in its efforts to defend the Bosniak majority against ethnic Serbs and Croats. "After our honorable battle, we have lived to see the day when we must defend the honor of our generals," Fiso said. Veteran Sanin Musa described Dudakovic as a "symbol of the defense of Bosnia and Bosnians." Read more: Sarajevo prosecutors charge
