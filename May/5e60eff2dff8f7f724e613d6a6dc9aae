Four German men were charged by the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt on Tuesday for being the alleged operators of the child pornography platform "Elysium." Investigators hope the case will deal a new blow to a growing child porn market on the so-called darknet, a shadowy part of the internet favored by criminals.

Investigators believe it may have been a copy of a US based child porn platform that was raided in the same year. Huge membership: Prosecutors say Elysium was used to exchange illegal videos and photos, and had 111,000 registered members. The site contained recordings of the "most serious sexual abuse", even of small children. A major disruption to child porn: The case has been described as one of the biggest disruptions to the global child pornography scene in recent years. It is the first ever case against alleged German perpetrators of a child porn platform on the darknet. How the case will proceed: The Limburg district court must now decide whether to accept the charges and proceed to trial.
