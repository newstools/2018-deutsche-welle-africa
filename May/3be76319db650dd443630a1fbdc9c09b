German automobile association ACV said the decision had "finally provided a legal framework for the use of dashcams on German roads. Why would a dashcam recording be illegal? Germany has very strict data protection regulations. The BGH said a recording contravened the Germany's data protection law because people unrelated to the accident were filmed without giving their explicit consent. Potential solution: The BGH suggested that it is "technically possible" for dashcams to only save footage when an accident has taken place. This could serve as reasonable evidence after an accident and would not break data protection rules. How many dashcams are there in Germany? According to Bitkom, around 150,000 dashcams were sold in Germany since 2015.
