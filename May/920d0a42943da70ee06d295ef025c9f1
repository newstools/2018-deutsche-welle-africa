Deutsche Bank, which is expected to announce a range of restructuring measures to coincide with its annual shareholder meeting Thursday, appears set to cut a total of 10,000 jobs by 2019 — about a tenth of its global workforce.

The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on Wednesday, citing unnamed sources as saying that the workforce reduction was part of stepped-up cost-cutting efforts by the bank's new chief executive Christian Sewing. In a surprise move last month, Deutsche Bank Chairman Paul Achleitner abruptly replaced chief executive John Cryan with Christian Sewing amid investor complaints that the bank was falling behind in executing a turnaround plan. Under Cryan, the bank had a previous target of 9,000 cuts by 2020, though the Frankfurt-based lender may have made less than a third of those cuts. According to WSJ, the latest plan comes after weeks of debate over how fast and deep job losses at the struggling German lender should be. Plans for fewer layoffs had divided senior executives and left investors unconvinced, people familiar with internal bank discussions told WSJ. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on requests from several news media. Shares in Germany's biggest private lender have fallen 31 percent this year, sparking calls from investors to speed up the recovery process. Hans-Christoph Hirt, head of shareholder adviser Hermes EOS at Hermes Investment Management, told Reuters on Wednesday he wanted to see a "credible strategy with achievable targets," adding that it was critical that the recent CEO appointment "works outs."

Read more: Deutsche Bank's deep strategic hole Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Sewing was planning to sharply reduce Deutsche Bank's presence in the US market and to started cutting activity in the Central Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Citing people familiar with the strategy, Bloomberg said that the decision was the result of a "wide-ranging review of the bank's global equities business." Part of the plan was a decision to scale back the bank's business services for hedge funds, and the trading of stocks would also be affected. Among those to leave the bank are London-based head of CEEMEA equity sales Darren Veenhuis, as well as Pascal Moura, who runs equity research for the region from Dubai. The CEEMEA desk specializes in trading emerging-market securities and had been singled out as one area where Deutsche Bank needs to reassess how it competes with other investment banks, the people said. Deutsche Bank's supervisory board and senior executives will confront investors Thursday in Frankfurt at its annual shareholder meeting. They will face a proposal to break up the company and probing questions about last month's chief executive handoff. The lender is also under pressure from credit ratings agencies after losing much of its credibility and billions in fines as a result of the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Standard & Poor's is expected to say by the end of the month whether it will cut Deutsche Bank's rating after putting it on "credit watch" in April.
