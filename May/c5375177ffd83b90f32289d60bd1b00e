Emmanuel Macron will be speaking to German broadcasters Deutsche Welle and ARD Tagesthemen on Wednesday, with what's left of the Iran nuclear deal liable to dominate the discussion. Nevertheless, the French president's plans for the European Union and Franco-German relations are sure to feature. Macron won France's presidential elections one year ago, campaigning on an economically centrist but socially liberal platform, with a heavy focus on the EU. He's a strong advocate for increased European political integration, in areas including defense and financial policy, and managing sovereign debt within the bloc. Both a transcript and a video of the interview will be published right here (http://dw.com/p/2xQa3) as soon as possible. The interview will be broadcast on DW's English news channel in the hour starting at 8 p.m. in Germany (1800 UTC/GMT), with a German-language version airing an hour later. Macron will also visit Germany to receive the Charlemagne Prize — awarded each year to people who have made conspicuous contributions to European unity — in the border town of Aachen on Thursday.
