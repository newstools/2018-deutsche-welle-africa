Pashinian failed Tuesday to persuade individual lawmakers to cross party lines so he could amass the 53-vote majority he needed in the 105-seat legislature. He described his setback as an "insult to the people" and said he was calling a campaign of civil disobedience from early Wednesday that would include blockades of key transport routes. "Get sober until [before] it's too late, because your behavior could cause a political tsunami," he told Republican parliamentarians. Follow-on vote next week?

Outside parliament in Yerevan thousands of Armenians had rallied in support of the 42-year-old dissident whose protest movement Elk (The Way Out) last month forced the resignation of president-turned-premier Serzh Sargsyan.
