Officers in the town of Schwandorf said they found the hedgehog wandering aimlessly on a local road with a plastic cup stuck on its head. Police removed the cup after they realized the hungry critter was not able to free itself. "The hedgehog was looking for something to eat and came across the cup," regional newspaper Mittelbayerische Zeitung quoted the police as saying. "It could not resist the temptation."
