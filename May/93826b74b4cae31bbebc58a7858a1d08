Ronald Brautigam has recorded over 60 CDs, including the complete works of Mozart and Haydn on the fortepiano. Critics have called his renditions of Beethoven on that early version of the piano "a stylistic paradigm shift." Here he also performs a piece by Beethoven's onetime teacher, Joseph Haydn. It's one with which Haydn really lets his hair — or his wig — down; not so much for the musical ideas in it as for its sheer energy. From Beethoven's own student Ferdinand Ries, a strange composition written in London called "The Dream" is also scheduled. Amused, Brautigam observes that "Beethoven can be as free as he likes but there's still an underlying structure in these sonatas that is so strong that it keeps everything together. But with Ries you just fall from one surprise into another. Once it's finished you think, 'What the hell was that?' But it's a fantastic piece. It's great to play, it's so full of ideas and it's so full of Beethoven, shamelessly." About Beethoven himself much is known, says Ronald Brautigam, but maybe the essential thing will forever remain a mystery: "That's one of my frustrations, that we'll never know how he played the piano himself when he was fantasizing or improvising, and that must have been 10 times wilder than what he wrote down on paper."
