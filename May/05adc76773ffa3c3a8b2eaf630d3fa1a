Hazem Abdel-Azim, who had campaigned for President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, became one of the president's harshest critics after abandoning the campaign trail in the 2014 elections. Abdel-Azim was taken from his home in a Cairo suburb Saturday night, and accused of belonging to an outlawed group and disseminating fake news. On his Twitter profile, Abdel-Azim says: "I have been right and I have made mistakes, and my biggest mistake was accepting to join Sissi's campaign." He has 752,000 followers on the social media site and regularly criticized the president. Abdel-Azim had been a deputy telecoms minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak before chairing the youth committee for el-Sissi's election campaign four years ago. Police officials spoke about Abdel-Azim’s detention on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the press. Reuters said three security sources had confirmed the reports.
