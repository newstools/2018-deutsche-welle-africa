Wolfsburg 1 - 4 Olympique Lyonnais (Harder 93' - Henry 98, Le Sommer 99', Hegerberg 103',  Abily 116') Wolfsburg played 120 minutes for the second time in a week following Saturday's German Cup final win against Bayern Munich, and by the end of Thursday's final in Kyiv, it showed. A drab, goalless 90 minutes was followed by an extra time rollercoaster that offered the Wolves the briefest taste of glory, only for Lyon to emphatically snatch it back. The joy after Penille Harder's opening goal could scarcely have been more fleeting Pernille Harder put the Wolves ahead early in extra time, but moments later Alexandra Popp was dismissed for her second bookable offense. The attacker protested her innocence with the match officials, but replays showed her arriving late and clumsily, suggesting a correct decision. Wolfsburg then conceded three goals in five minutes, as Lyon romped to a third consecutive Champions League win. Two years ago, they had beaten the Wolves on penalties in the final. German international Dzsenifer Marozsan was the creator for Lyon's first, feeding Amandine Henry who volleyed home with panache. Eugenie Le Sommer, Norway's Ada Hegerberg and Camille Abily all got in on the act as Wolfsburg imploded in extra time. Lyon and Wolfsburg are two of the giants of the women's game, having won seven of the last eight Champions League titles between them. Only once in recent years, when FFC Frankfurt faced Paris Saint-Germain in 2014-15, was neither club represented in the final. Read more: Wolfsburg: A tale of contrasting fortunes
