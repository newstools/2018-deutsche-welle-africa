This week's eco@africa travels from South Africa to Gambia as we check out a host of bright ideas for a more environmentally-friendly world. First, we check out how invasive tree species in South Africa are being chopped down to protect native flora and fauna. But rather than being wasted, the wood is turned into furniture, which is then supplied to schools badly in need of it. The initiative also provides jobs for the local community. Next, we’re off to Gambia, when environmental activists have come up with an eye-catching way to recycle bicycle tire inner tubes: turning them into attractive necklaces. We then travel to Germany, where conservation groups are battling to bring back to life a wetland – even more crucial for the climate than forests - that has been depleted after 200 years of peat mining. A trip to Kenya is up next – the island of Lamu is being overwhelmed with plastic waste washing up on its shores. That’s bad news for mangroves, turtles – and also the tourism which is so vital for the island’s economy. That’s provoked local residents to take a stand to protect their beaches. Over in Ethiopia, researchers are on a quest for the super chicken: developing a disease-resistant, climate-resilient chicken could help the country adapt to climate change and improve nutrition. We end our show with a stop-off in Nigeria, where almost 200 million people live. With a growing population to feed, small firms are turning to hydroponics – growing plants without soil – as a potential solution.
