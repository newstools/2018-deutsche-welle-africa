The Cannes Film Festival is one of the most eagerly awaited events in the world of cinema. Those who attend get to mingle with stars in a beautiful location. We picked four places where you can watch movies and would like to know, which of these is your favorite? To take part, all you need to do is select your favorite place for watching films, and tell us why it’s your favorite.  At home on the couch  At the cinema  At festivals  At outdoor cinemas  None of these places is the one I like best.  To say thank you for participating, you will be entered into a draw to win a Euromaxx wristwatch.   The deadline for sending us your entry is 11 May, 2018, 12 UTC. All decisions are final. Good luck!
