Wall-to-wall musical fireworks, young stars, glamour and stories of love and ridiculousness, tragedy, seduction, death and all the ironies of life are what we have in store for you in the continuation of the Opera Gala in Bonn for the German AIDS Foundation. With income exceeding expenses by 230,000 euros ($277,000), the 2018 event set a new record — and in the seven years of these galas in Bonn, over one million euros have been raised for the foundation's work. It benefits people who have fallen on hard times due to their infection with the immune deficiency syndrome, including infected mothers in Africa who are expecting a child, to help them get the medication they need to prevent transmission of the virus to their unborn children. The foundation also funds medical research, including the search for a vaccine, and fosters communication about HIV and AIDS, which in some parts of society remains a taboo subject.

We don't have any time to prepare for the next piece, for the next style. So it's not just fun, it's also a hard job. But everyone does this with a sense of fun, even though it's also stress."
