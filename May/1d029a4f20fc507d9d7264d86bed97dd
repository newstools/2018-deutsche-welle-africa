Rescue teams from Suriname — South America's smallest country — were again searching nearby coastal waters on Thursday after a group of at least 12 fishermen disappeared last week while fishing on four ships. The men were the apparent victims of local pirates who have terrorized the Atlantic Ocean coasts of Suriname, Guyana, and neighboring Venezuela for years.

His counterpart in Suriname, President Desi Bouterse, has faced criticism for not speaking publicly about the incidents. The director of Suriname's national disaster coordination center, Lieutenant Colonel Jerry Slijngard, said the rescue operation had been hampered by unfavorable sea conditions. Describing Wednesday's latest attack, the secretary of the Suriname Fishermen's Society, Mark Lall, said the whereabouts of the remaining members of the ship's crew are uncertain.
