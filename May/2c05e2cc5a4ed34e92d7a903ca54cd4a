An Iranian court on Sunday sentenced eight men to death over attacks claimed by the "Islamic State" last June. The men were found guilty of helping the five terrorists who attacked the parliament and a shrine to Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the head of the Tehran Revolutionary Courts, Mousa Ghazanfarabadi, told state TV. Ghazanfarabadi said the sentence could be appealed within 20 days in Iran's Supreme Court. A further 18 people face trial over the attacks, according to the court's director.
