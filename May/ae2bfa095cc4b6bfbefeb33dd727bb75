Reggie Lucas, the Grammy-winning musician who played with Miles Davis in the 1970s and produced the bulk of Madonna's debut album, has died. He was 65. The performer's daughter, Lisa Lucas, told The Associated Press that her father died from complications with his heart early Saturday in New York City. "After a long and arduous struggle with his physical heart (his emotional one was perfect) he was called home. I wish he'd had more time, I wish we'd all had more time with him, but he left this world absolutely covered in love, with his hands held and his family beside him. I'm glad he's at peace now," Lisa Lucas wrote on her Facebook page. Lucas was born on February 25, 1953 in the Queens borough of New York City. A career musician, he played guitar with jazz legend Miles Davis in the 1970s.
