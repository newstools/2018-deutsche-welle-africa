Irish rider Sam Bennett of the Bora-hansgrohe team won Sunday's 21st and final stage of the Giro d'Italia, but Britain's Chris Froome claimed the overall victory. The final stage was a low-key affair for Froome, in stark contrast to his surprising solo attack up the Colle delle Finestre that had launched him into the overall lead on Friday. The 33-year-old Froome secured his maiden victory at the 101st edition of the Giro, when the race jury neutralized the final, 118-kilometer stage, after just three of 11 scheduled laps in Rome due to the poor condition of the streets in the Italian capital. Historic achievement The Kenyan-born Briton is only the third rider, after Bernard Hinault and Eddy Merckx, to hold the Tour de France, Spanish Vuelta and Giro titles at the same time. However, Froome's victory is not without controversy as he remains the subject of an investigation by cycling's world governing body, the UCI, after a urine sample taken from him at last year's Vuelta turned up excessive levels of the asthma medication salbutamol. If the UCI finds him guilty of doping, the captain of the Sky team could face a ban on competition and his results from each race he has taken part in since September 2017 — including the 2018 Giro — could be annulled. However, Froome has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and reiterated this claim following Saturday's penultimate stage. "I have a clear conscience," he said. "As I said, when the time is right, all the information will be shared with everyone and I’m sure people will see it from my point of view." pfd (dpa, SID, Reuters)
