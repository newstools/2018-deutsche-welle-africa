Germany will continue to enjoy rising tax revenue over the next few years, with some €60 billion ($72 billion) more in state coffers by 2022 than was estimated by the government in an official assessment last November, a newspaper said on Sunday. In a report ahead of the next official estimate scheduled for Wednesday, Handelsblatt said the federal government and the state governments could each expect €26 billion more, with the remaining money going to municipal administrations.

Assessors had put that figure at around €890 billion in their November estimate, according to the paper, up from €675 billion in 2017.
