Plastic has become one of the biggest environmental problems of our time. We produce nearly 300 million tons of plastic waste each year — and an estimated 8 million tons of that ends up in the oceans. Plastic doesn't biodegrade — it sticks around forever. Unless drastic action is taken, researchers warn we might have more plastic trash than fish in the oceans by 2050. This is why the European Commission plans to ban single-use plastic products. Plastic straws, plates and cutlery are convenient and cheap, but they are not the only option. There are many green alternatives — some you can even eat!
