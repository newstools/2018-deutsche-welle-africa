Macedonia's former head of government, Nikola Gruevski, unlawfully influenced state officials to buy a Mercedes worth around â‚¬600,000 ($702,207), and then kept the vehicle for personal use, a court in Skopje found on Wednesday. Judge Dobrila Kacarska sentenced the embattled politician to two years in prison. The former prime minister is to remain free pending an appeal. Prosecutors say Gruevski called his then-interior minister Gordana Jankulovska in 2012 and urged her to order the purchase of the luxury armored car. According to audio evidence, Gruevski said that he would use the car and the public would be kept in the dark. Moreover, Gruevski apparently received a kickback from a car dealer in exchange for commercial promotion after the purchase. On Thursday, judge Kacarska said the former prime minister "lied and ridiculed citizens" and was "intentionally trying to hide the vehicle."

The 47-year-old politician was not present in the courtroom on Wednesday.
