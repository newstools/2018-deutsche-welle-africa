Air France-KLM CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac said Friday he would step down "within days" after staff at the carrier rejected a company pay offer aimed at ending a series of strikes in recent weeks. Airline officials said 55.4 percent of employees voted against the pay deal that included a 7-percent pay rise over four years. Unions kept holding out for a 5.1-percent increase in wages this year alone to make up for a pay freeze and inflationary effects since 2012. "I hope my departure will enable people to take stock and to start on creating the conditions for a recovery," Janaillac said in a statement Friday. Operational losses a headache The airline, which emerged from a tie-up between Air France and KLM Royal Dutch in 2004, earlier on Friday released quarterly earnings figures, announcing losses for the first three months of the year. Operating losses grew from €33 million ($39.4 million) in the first quarter of 2017 to €118 million in the same quarter this year. Strikes in recent weeks were responsible for huge additional in losses, the company said, with further industrial action planned for May 7 and May 8. The first-quarter losses came despite strong customer demand, with passenger numbers up by 5.2 percent to 22 million in the January-to-March period.
