Firefighters have saved an adventurous young cow from a bridge in the southern German state of Bavaria near the Austrian border. Hikers informed local police after spotting the forlorn bovine on scaffolding along the side of the Arzmoosbrücke bridge south of Rosenheim on Saturday evening. "[The cow] panicked and fell down two stories of planks between the bridge and the scaffold," Flintsbach fire service said. After landing on the scaffold, a 5-meter (16-foot) gap stopped the cow from moving any further.

The owner was also present to reassure the cow during the ordeal. As to why it had strayed so far from its herd and tried to cross the bridge, Flintsbach fire service said the answer was "clear." The young cow wanted an "adventure" after having "become quickly bored with the cattle life." Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's news and feature journalism.
