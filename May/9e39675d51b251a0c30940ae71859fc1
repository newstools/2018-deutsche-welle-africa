After thousands of protesters blocked roads and interrupted train services in Armenia's capital of Yerevan on Wednesday, protest leader Nikol Pashinian urged the anti-government demonstrators to pause protests on Thursday. The one-day timeout should allow Pashinian to consult his fellow lawmakers as part of his push towards becoming prime minister. "Kids, you are going to school tomorrow," Pashinian told a crowd in Yerevan. "Tomorrow, we will be working in parliament." Armenian parliament, which is dominated by deputies from the party of long-time president Serzh Sargsyan, rejected Pashinian's initial bid on Tuesday. On Wednesday, however, ruling party officials said they would back the candidate who won one-third of the vote, signaling a change of heart on widely popular Pashinian. The move is in accordance with Armenia's constitution, which requires a party that does not have its own candidate to vote for a candidate who gains at least one-third of lawmakers' votes.
