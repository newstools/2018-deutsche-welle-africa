The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island erupted at 4:45 p.m. local time (0345 a.m. Friday UTC), spewing lava and releasing noxious steam into nearby residential areas. Some 1,700 residents at Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens had to be evacuated; other residents in the Puna district were also asked to leave their homes. In total, around 10,000 people were affected. A drone video captured by resident resident Jeremiah Osuna  showed lava inching its way through Puna. Speaking on Honolulu television station KOHN, he called it a "curtain of fire." "It sounded like if you were to put a bunch of rocks into a dryer and turn it on as high as you could," he said. Big Island resident Janice Wei told the AFP news agency she felt "a big shake underneath my feet," and then said immediately afterwards, she saw a giant pink plume of smoke.
