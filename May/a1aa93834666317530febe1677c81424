The 39-year-old aircraft was leased by Cuban flagship carrier Cubana from little-known Mexican company Damojh. Mexico's civil aviation authority suspended the charter company's operations on Monday. The department said it was conducting an "extraordinary" review amid complaints about its maintenance practices and safety standards. The fiery crash, which happened shortly after takeoff from Havana, was Cuba's deadliest air disaster in nearly 30 years. aw/gsw (AP, Reuters, AFP)
