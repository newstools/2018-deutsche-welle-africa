A day after the end of Men's Fashion Week, Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2018 week kicked off on Monday with a presentation by fashion label Schiaparelli. Its latest offering featured intricately embroidered pieces and patterns inspired by the Maasai people from southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. The label's design director, Bertrand Guyon, said he aimed to combine European and African elegance with the line. Unusual fabrics, including shredded plastic bags, were interwoven with silk.
