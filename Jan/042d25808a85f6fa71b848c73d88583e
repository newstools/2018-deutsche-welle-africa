Roger Federer pivotally overcame a poor start to seal a spot in the Australian Open semifinals, beating Tomas Berdych 7-6(1), 6-3, 6-4. Federer started poorly and when Berdych jumped to a surprise 4-1 lead, the script was torn up. With the Swiss spluttering, Berdych found himself 5-3 up and serving for the set. However, as with all sporting greats, it's never over until it's over. Two break points came and went for Federer - one after a Federer challenge couldn't be reviewed because the technology didn't work. Berdych then missed the chance to win the set and Federer roared back with monstrous execution to seal the break of serve. Federer brought it level, Berdych responded and after Federer overcame a doube fault that nearly gifted the set, the world number two found another gear to take the tiebreak 6-1 with a delicious backhand drop shot. In the second set, Federer's strong played continued as he held off Berdych's attempts to wrestle back control. Not for the first time in the Czech's career, he looked in a match with a top player but couldn't convert that into games. Federer took the second set 6-3. Berdych took an off-court medical evaluation, but came back out. Initially it looked as though Berdych might have been better off staying off court as Federer broke serve early. Although the world number 20 showed fight by breaking back immediately, his own serve proved a problem and Federer took advantage again. From there, the 19-time Grand Slam winner never looked back.
