Authorities in Myanmar's restive Rakhine state confirmed on Wednesday that they shot dead several people when a nationalist celebration became violent late Tuesday night. Around 4,000 ethnic Rakhine Buddhists gathered at a local government office and began throwing stones before attempting to seize the office late on Tuesday local time, local officials and police said.

The group of ethnic Rakhine had gathered to mark the 223rd anniversary of the end of the Arakan dynasty, the last Rakhine kingdom, at an ancient Buddhist complex in Mrauk U. It was not immediately clear why the celebration turned violent. The Rakhine state's government secretary, Tin Maung Swe, told the dpa news agency that attendees began to protest after they were told the celebration could not be held on the archaeologically significant site.

  Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/2q5p6 Tensions in Rakhine state Ethnic Rakhine, who are one of the 135 ethnicities present in Myanmar, have a regional identity tied to the Arakanese kingdom which was toppled by the Burmese in 1784. Many of them are poor, marginalized and have poor relations with the Myanmar state, which is dominated by ethnic Bamar. The riot also occurred on the same day that a repatriation agreement was signed between Myanmar and Bangladesh to return hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees to Rakhine state after they fled a brutal military crackdown last August. Alongside their animosity for the Myanmar state, ethnic Rakhine reject the Rohingya, who they denounce as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh — despite their living in the predominantly Buddhist Myanmar for generations. Since August, more than 600,000 Rohingya have fled from Myanmar into Bangladesh. "The day the military came, they burnt down the village and shot my mother as she was trying to escape. My father couldn’t walk, so they stabbed him. I saw this with my own eyes," says 10-year-old Mohammed Belal who managed to run away from his village. Mohammed’s sister Nur also watched the slaughter. She and her brother now live in a shelter for unaccompanied children in Bangladesh. She can play there and gets regular meals, a stark contrast to her journey from Myanmar where she and her brother nearly starved. But she is still haunted by the trauma of the recent weeks. "I miss my parents, my home, my country," she says. The conflict, which has been going on for 70 years and is rooted in the post-World War II social organization of the country, has claimed more than 2,000 victims since 2016, including the mother of 12-year-old Rahman, above. "They set fire to my home, and my mother was ill, so she could not leave," he says. Dilu-Aara, 5, came to the camp with her sister Rojina after she witnessed her parents being murdered by the military. "I was crying all the time and the bullets were flying over our heads. I escaped somehow." The international aid agency Save the Children is helping minors who come to Kutupalong without parents. Children make up to 60 percent of all Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. Jaded Alam is among the hundreds of kids who came to Kutupalong without parents. Fortunately, his aunt cares for him — and very well, he admits. Jaded grew up in a village called Mandi Para where he used to love playing football, but everything changed when the military attacked. "They told us to leave our home. When I was running with my parents, they shot them. They died on the spot," he says. Not all families have been separated during their plight, however. Rahman Ali has been scouring the refugee camp for weeks now after his 10-year-old son Zifad disappeared. Rumors of child abductions have swirled around the camp for years, and Rahman fears his son has fallen prey to human traffickers. "I can't eat, I can’t sleep. I’m so upset! It’s like I’ve gone mad." When the shooting started, Sokina Khatun did all she could to protect her children — but she couldn't save Yasmine,15, and Jamalita, 20, who were in a neighboring village at the time. "Their throats were cut in front of their grandparents," she says. "I was numb, I couldn’t feel the pain. Right now my mind is not normal," she says. She managed to rescue nine of her offspring. Yasmine thinks she might be 15 but looks considerably younger. In her village, she used to play with marbles and run in the nearby fields, but different memories haunt her now: The attack by Myanmar forces, the beating and murder of her beloved father and brothers, and the rape by a group of Burmese soldiers who also robbed her. "I felt lots of pain in my body," she says. Author: Jan Tomes, John Owens rs/sms (AFP, dpa)
