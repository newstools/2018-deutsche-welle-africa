After finishing in ninth place in the 14th and final stage around Cordoba in Argentina, Carlos Sainz clinched the overall victory at the 40th Dakar Rally for Peugeot. The win was the second in the Spaniard's career and the third straight for Peugeot. The car builderÂ has announced it will bow out of the competition after this year's race. Sainz, 55, the father of Formula One driver Carlos Sainz Jr., previously won the Dakar Rally in 2010 with Volkswagen. Sainz, who was flanked by fellow Spaniard Lucas Cruz, finished more than 43 minutes head of Qatar's Nasser al-Attiyah in a Toyota in this year's rally, which occurred in South America for the 10th straight year after the race was moved from its original Paris-Dakar route in 2008 due to security concerns. Giniel de Villiers, who won the 14th stage, finished in third. dv/rc (AFP, Reuters)
