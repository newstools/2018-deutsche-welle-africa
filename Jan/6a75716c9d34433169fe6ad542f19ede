Schumann, whose real name was Heinz Jakob Schumann, was arrested in 1943 after authorities learned his mother was Jewish. He was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in German-occupied Czechoslovakia, where he played in the band known as the Ghetto Swingers. He was transferred to Auschwitz in 1944, where he was made to play music to entertain guards and welcome new arrivals to the concentration camp.
