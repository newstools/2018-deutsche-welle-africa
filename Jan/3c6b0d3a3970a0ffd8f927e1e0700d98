Just a day after sacking Hannes Wolf, Stuttgart have appointed Tayfun Korkut as their head coach. The Stuttgart-born coach has signed a deal until the summer of 2019 and returns to the club he coached at U19 level back in 2011. Korkut is a well known face in Germany after previous time as head coach of Hannover and Kaiserslautern. At the end of last season, he was named interim head coach of Bayer Leverkusen. In 11 games in charge, he collected just 11 points. As a player, Korkut played for Stuttgarter Kickers in his youth before going on to play in Spain and Turkey, where he was coached by Joachim Löw. He also made 43 appearances for Turkey. Stuttgart have one win and one draw in their last eight games. Nevertheless, Korkut's appointment has been met with a largely mixed response by both Bundesliga and Stuttgart fans alike. Korkut will take team training on Tuesday ahead of his first game as head coach, an away trip to Wolfsburg. Read more: Have Stuttgart made a mistake firing Wolf?
