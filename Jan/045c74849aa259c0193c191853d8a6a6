Berlin's public transportation company Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) placed its last two pairs of Adidas sneakers up for auction on eBay on Thursday, saying they will donate the proceeds to a local charity to benefit the city's homeless. "'They'll all end up on eBay anyway,' you said. Fine, then we're auctioning off our last two pairs to benefit the Kältehilfe [a charity that offers shelter to the homeless during the winter], since many people sleep outside, even if there's not a sneaker sale," BVG wrote on Twitter. Hundreds of people waited for hours in the cold — including some who'd camped out for days — for the shoes to go on sale at Adidas on January 16. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

The pattern on the shoe is the same as the infamous, graffiti-resistant covering of Berlin's subway train seats.

"We decided not to have the shoes sit in a display case with us. Rather, we wanted to make these two pairs available to fans as well — and to do something good at the same time," BVG's marketing head Martell Beck said in a statement. Bidding for the shoes started at €1, but quickly rose to over €1,000 ($1,240) for the larger pair and over €800 ($992) for the smaller pair. Bidding for the shoes will remain open until Sunday evening. The shoes originally sold at Adidas stores for €180 — a year-round ticket for the BVG normally costs €730. BVG partnered with Adidas to make the shoes in honor of the public transport company's 90th anniversary.
