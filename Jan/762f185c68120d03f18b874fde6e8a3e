The application was denied at the time because terms of paternity leave referred to the "father" of the child, not the "partner" of the child.

In its statement, the court said the institution of paternity leave was "designed to allow fathers to play a greater role in their children's upbringing" and to more equally distribute household tasks between men and women.
