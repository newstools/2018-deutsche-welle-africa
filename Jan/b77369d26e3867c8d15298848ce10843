The Cranberries lead singer Dolores O'Riordan died on Monday at the age of 46, her publicist has announced. O'Riordan was in London, where she was recording, when she died suddenly. The cause of her death was still not immediately available. In a statement carried by Irish broadcaster RTE, publicist Lindsey Holmes said the singer's family was devastated and had requested privacy at this very difficult time. The band later confirmed O'Riordan passing on their social media channels. The Cranberries shot to stardom in the 1990s with their debut album "Everyone Else is Doing it, So Why Can't We?" and hits such as "Linger," "Zombie" and "Dreams." According to the group's website, they sold over 40 million albums. The band split in 2003 but reunited several years later. In 2017, following the release of their last album "Something Else," the Cranberries announced a new tour with dates in Europe and the US. However, shortly into the European leg of their tour, the band was forced to cancel all remaining dates, citing O'Riordan's health issues. The group claimed in an official statement that the singer had been suffering from back problems. O'Riordan had also been known to suffer from bipolar disorder. She was spared a criminal conviction in 2014, after she admitted to assaulting three police officers and a flight attendant during a flight from New York to Ireland. After pleading guilty she was fined €6,000 ($7,362). dm/kms (Reuters, dpa)
