A team of five or six attackers, reportedly dressed in Afghan military uniforms, entered the hotel and set fire to its kitchen. The militants then took up positions on the fourth and fifth floors and went from room to room, gunning down guests. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault, which prompted an overnight siege of the six-storey venue. Many of the guests fled by jumping out of windows. The standoff ended with Afghan security forces, backed by Norwegian troops, killing all of the Taliban militants. At least seven Ukrainian citizens were among the dead, with one Greek and one Kazakh national also reported killed. dj/rt (AFP, dpa)
