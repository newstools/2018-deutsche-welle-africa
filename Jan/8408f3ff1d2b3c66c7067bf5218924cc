Award-winning writer Ursula K. Le Guin died peacefully in her home in Oregon, her son Theo Downes Le Guin said late on Tuesday. "She left an extraordinary legacy as an artist and as an advocate of peace and critical thinking and fairness, and she was a great mother and wife as well," he said. The 88-year-old author was widely considered one of the pillars of fantasy and science fiction genres. Her breakthrough novel "The Left Hand of Darkness," published in 1969, challenged gender roles by portraying an alien race with no fixed sex. The book won multiple awards, including the prestigious Hugo and Nebula honors.

British-born Neil Gaiman, also a Hugo and Nebula winner, said Le Guin's words were "written on his soul" In recent years, Le Guin warned against over-emphasizing profit to motivate writers and their publishers. "I really don't want to watch American literature get sold down the river," she said while accepting a honorary National Book Award in 2014. "We who live by writing and publishing want - and should demand - our fair share of the proceeds. But the name of our beautiful reward is not profit. Its name is freedom." dj/es (AP, dpa, AFP)
