Police in adjacent Karlsruhe said the two aircraft, including a rescue helicopter, collided mid-air and fell to the ground near a gravel pit. The German air rescue organization DRF said its helicopter had been on a training flight in the Speyer city area to the north. "Based on the current information, both pilots of the DRF Air Rescue as well as the two occupants of the light aircraft lost their lives," DRF said in an initial press release, adding it was wholly unclear what caused the collision. Details scarce A police spokesman said that initial details on the collision were scarce. "We do not yet know who was in which aircraft," the spokesman said, when asked if further casualties were possible. "First we need to establish an overview." The crash scene lies about five kilometers (around 3 miles) east from Philippsburg, a town of 13,000 and its adjacent Philippsburg nuclear plant. Plant untouched Initial reports suggested the plant was untouched. The crash scene was sealed off. The plant, on the banks of the river Rhine, has one active reactor which is due to shut down in 2019. It belongs to Energie Baden-Württemberg (EnBW), a publicly-traded concern, now focused on renewable energy capture, whose shares are largely in the hands of the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg and its municipalities. Campaigning for closure German environmental groups, including Greenpeace, have long campaigned for the closure of Philippsburg II. The plant's first reactor block, Philippsburg I, is currently being dismantled. It was closed down in 2011, the year of Japan's Fukushima disaster. ipj/msh (AFP, dpa)
