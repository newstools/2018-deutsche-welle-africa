Needing a victory to contend for a spot in the semifinals, Germany's handball team lost 26-25 to Denmark in Varazdin, Croatia on Sunday to all but confirm their elimination from the European Championship. Germany did not score their first goal until the 10th minute as Denmark shut down several of their best scorers. Captain Uwe Gensheimer, who scored nine goals in their opening win against Montenegro, was limited to one goal (on two shots) in the game. With the loss, Germany now have to hope that other teams in their group — namely Macedonia and Spain — drop points in order to have a chance to qualify for the coming weekend's semifinals. "At the moment, our disappointment is stronger than our hope," said right winger Tobias Reichmann after the game. Hans Lindberg lead the way for Denmark with nine goals, four of which came from the penalty mark. Denmark's largest lead of the game was just three goals as Germany battled back late in the second-half, albeit in vain. "We fought, but there were some unlucky decisions in which we were a little too naïve," Germany coach Christian Prokop said afterwards. Germany, who won the last European Championship in 2016, have one game left in the main round against Spain on Wednesday. Until then, the just have to hope results fall their way.
