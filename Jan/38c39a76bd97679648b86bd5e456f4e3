Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Wednesday he plans to attend the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea despite an ongoing disagreement between the two countries over a "comfort women" deal. "I would like to attend the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Olympics to cheer on Japanese athletes if conditions allow me to do so," Abe told Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun on Wednesday.

He noted, however, that he would like to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to discuss a 2015 reparations deal. "I want to hold a summit meeting to firmly convey Japan's stance on the agreement over the 'comfort women' issue," Abe told reporters. South Korea's presidential office said in a statement that they welcomed Abe's decision to attend the games. Abe previously hinted that he might not attend the event to instead focus on passing a budget bill, a move that was interpreted as a possible slight to Seoul over the dispute.
