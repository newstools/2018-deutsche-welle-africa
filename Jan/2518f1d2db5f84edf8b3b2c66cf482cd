The children of the late rights activist Martin Luther King condemned US President Donald Trump's alleged comments over African countries, as thousands of Americans honored the late civil rights leader on Monday by protesting against the president. Nowhere were tensions as high as near Trump's Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida, where protests broke out between Haitian-Americans and Trump-supporters. The events follow the president's alleged remarks during a meeting with senators on immigration last week, in which he described African states as "s***hole countries."

Trump denied the expletive rant, but admitted that the language he used during the meeting on immigration was "tough." The King family response Responding to the reports on Monday, King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, denounced the president, saying: "When a president insists that our nation needs more citizens from white states like Norway, I don't think we need to spend any time even talking about what it says and what it is." He added, "We got to find a way to work on this man's heart." Martin Luther King III insisted: "We got to find a way to work on this man's heart." King's daughter, the Reverend Bernice King, told the hundreds of people packed inside the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta that they "cannot allow the nations of the world to embrace the words that come from our president as a reflection of the true spirit of America." She added: "We are one people, one nation, one blood, one destiny. ... All of civilization and humanity originated from the soils of Africa."

Footage captured by local broadcaster WPEC-TV showed several dozen pro-Haitian protestors waving Haitian flags and chanting "Our country is not a s***hole." Across the street, the smaller pro-Trump contingent waved US flags and Trump campaign posters. One man could also be seen yelling at Haitians to "go back to their s***holes." No violent unrest was reported. One Trump supporter was filmed telling Haitian protestors to "go back to their s***holes." Trump keeps low profile on MLK day The president, meanwhile, decamped to his Florida retreat to keep a low profile over the federal holiday. Trump did dedicate his weekly address to the nation, released on Monday, to King. "Dr. King's dream is our dream, it is the American dream, it's the promise stitched into the fabric of our nation, etched into the hearts of our people and written into the soul of humankind," Trump said in the address, which was also tweeted out to his followers. His tribute to the civil rights leader, however, did little to calm the firestorm over his comments. Earlier on Sunday, the president was forced to deny he wasn't racist, telling reports, "I am the least racist person you have ever interviewed." Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
