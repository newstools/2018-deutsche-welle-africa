A residential district of the east Libyan city of Benghazi was hit by two car bombs on Tuesday, leaving dozens of civilians, medics and security officials dead. At least 34 people were killed and more than 87 others wounded in the blasts, hospital sources said on Wednesday. Previously, health officials said many of the wounded were in a critical condition. The military said that Ahmad al-Fitouri, a security services official loyal to general Khalifa Haftar, was also killed.

It was not immediately clear who was behind the bombings.

Libya has been rocked by chaos since a 2011 uprising, which was backed by NATO, overthrew and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Since 2014, the country has been split between rival governments in Libya's eastern and western regions, each backed by different tribes and militias. The lawlessness has provided fertile ground for people smugglers taking advantage of migrants and asylum seekers attempting to travel to Europe. The UN backs a unity government in the western capital Tripoli. Last year, the troops of general Khalifa Haftar took control of Benghazi from Islamists, who had made it a stronghold following the revolution. Bombings and attacks still occur in the port city. rs/se (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
