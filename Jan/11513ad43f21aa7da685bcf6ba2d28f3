Taliban militants have claimed responsibility for Saturday's deadly attack on the luxury Intercontinental Hotel in the Afghan capital, Kabul. The assault left 18 people dead and many others wounded. "Fourteen foreigners were killed and four Afghans," Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish told Afghanistan's Tolo News. Other sources said the death toll was much higher. Among the victims was one Kyrgyz national, one Greek, several Ukrainians and at least three others whose nationalities are still unknown, another ministry spokesman said. Local airline Kam Air said as many as 10 of its pilots and air crew, most of them foreigners, had been killed.

Danish told Tolo News several hours later that all four militants had been killed and that the attack was over.

Abdul Rahman Naseri, a guest who was at the hotel for a conference, managed to escape out the window after he saw the gunmen enter the building. "They were shouting...'Don't leave any of them alive, good or bad'. 'Shoot and kill them all,' one of them shouted," Naseri told Reuters news agency. "I ran to my room on the second floor. I opened the window and tried to get out using a tree but the branch broke and I fell to the ground. I hurt my back and broke a leg." The Taliban later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying five of its gunmen, armed with suicide vests, had entered the hotel. The luxury venue, which is popular with foreigners and locals alike, was previously targeted by Taliban insurgents almost six years ago.

The target of the attack was Kabul's heavily fortified diplomatic area in the "Green Zone." The German Embassy in the area was extensively damaged. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Taliban and the self-styled "Islamic State" (IS) have staged large attacks in the city in the past. The blast in Kabul's diplomatic enclave was the latest in a long line of attacks on the Afghan capital. Earlier in May, eight foreign soldiers were killed in a bomb attack claimed by IS. In March, insurgents attacked an Afghan military hospital in Kabul's diplomatic district, killing 38 people and injuring more than 70 others, namely patients, doctors and nurses. In April, Afghanistan's Taliban vowed to ramp up assaults on coalition and Afghan security forces, announcing the start of their annual spring offensive. The group said they were changing tactics for this year's operation, naming it "Operation Mansour" after the group's late leader who was killed in 2016 in a US drone strike. US President Donald Trump has yet to announce his Afghanistan policy. Afghanistan expert Michael Kugleman told DW Trump's Afghanistan policy will in many ways be quite similar to that of the Obama administration. "Like Obama, Trump will likely also express support for the idea of reconciliation between the Taliban and the Afghan government," said Kugelman. But the Taliban have shown no interest in peace talks. Afghanistan observers say it is unlikely that the militant group will engage in any negotiations as they currently have the upper hand on the battleground. The Islamists now control more Afghan districts than at any other time since 2001. President Ghani said last year his country "no longer expects Pakistan to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table." Experts say Islamabad uses Taliban militants as proxy jihadists to counter Indian influence in Afghanistan. Former Pakistani Taliban spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan (pictured), was recently captured and pardoned by Islamabad after he accused India of supporting the Taliban. Apart from the Taliban, the Afghan warlords excercise massive influence in the country. Earlier in May, Hizb-i-Islami leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar returned to Kabul after a 20-year exile to play an active role in Afghan politics. In September 2016, the Afghan government signed a deal with Hekmatyar in the hope that other warlords and militant groups would seek better ties with Kabul. Russia has increased its involvement in Afghanistan. Moscow had maintained an apparent distance from the Afghan conflict for many years but a new geopolitical situation is emerging in the region, and it seems that Russia has decided not to remain "neutral" in the protracted conflict. In the past few months, Russia has hosted a number of Afghanistan conferences involving China, Pakistan and Iran. In the midst of an endless battle for power, President Ghani's approval ratings continue to plummet. Rampant corruption in the Afghan government and a long tug-of-war within the US-brokered national unity government has had a negative impact on the government's efforts to eradicate terrorism. Author: Shamil Shams Soft target On Thursday, the US Embassy in Kabul issued a warning to US citizens, saying it was "aware of reports that extremist groups may be planning an attack against hotels in Kabul." DW's correspondent in Kabul, Shadi Khan Saif, said that although it was not a top-level target, the Intercontinental stood on a hill and had three checkpoints; so the incursion would raise security questions. "The Intercontinental Hotel is a soft target, it's not a secure installation, and there aren't government or foreign offices there," he said. "It was not an obvious target, but security around hotels is tight in Afghanistan. So it's really a failure that terrorists have been able to enter." Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

The hotel was also targeted in June 2011, when a suicide attack claimed by the Taliban killed 21 people, including 10 civilians. Afghan authorities increased security in the capital in the wake of a truck bombing that ripped through the diplomatic quarter in May and killed some 150 people. Despite efforts by the country's security forces, attacks are frequent. More than 20 bombings and attacks in Kabul alone in 2017 left around 500 people dead and scores more injured. Elsewhere in Afghanistan on Sunday, a roadside bomb killed at least 13 civilians in the western Herat province and 18 members of local militia forces in the northern province of Balkh.
