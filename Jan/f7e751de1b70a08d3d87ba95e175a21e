It can be hard to come up with revolutionary new styles these days — we've already seen practically everything. That's why some fashion designers, eager to show off their creativity, go for materials that some of us would consider a bit weird. A famous example is the dress American singer Lady Gaga wore during the MTV Music Video Awards in 2010, when she took to the stage in a garment made of raw beef. The, um, tasteful ensemble created by Argentine designer Franc Fernandez was accented with a hat, shoes and a handbag made of steak. Equally edible, but far less smelly, are dresses shown at the Salon du Chocolat. Part of the opening ceremony at the annual fair promoting the latest chocolate trends is a huge fashion show presenting dresses made of the world's favorite treat. Each year, renowned chocolate producers get together with famous fashion designers like France's Isadora Delarose and Jean Luc Decluzeau to create dresses, hats, corsages and even jewelry made of chocolate. One of the biggest challenges is to make them durable, so they won't melt during the show — a difficult endeavor once room temperatures reach 30 degree Celsius (upwards of 85 degrees Fahrenheit). Our High Five ranking takes a closer look at these confectionery creations, and other fashion articles made of unusual materials.
