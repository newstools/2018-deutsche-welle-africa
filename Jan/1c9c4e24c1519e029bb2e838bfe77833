Mexico witnessed nearly 30,000 murders last year, making it the deadliest year since the government started recording figures in the 1990s, the Mexican Interior Ministry reported on Sunday. The Interior Ministry said authorities across Mexico opened 29,168 murder cases, saying that it put the country's homicide rate at 20.5 per 100,000 inhabitants. In comparison, Germany's murder rate in 2014 was 0.9 per 100,000 people, according to World Bank data. Read more: How dangerous are vacations in Mexico?
