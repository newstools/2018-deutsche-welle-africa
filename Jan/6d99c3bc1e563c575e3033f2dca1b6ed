Trump has consistently criticized what he sees as the failings of globalization, focusing on issues around free trade and the US trading relationship with other countries, as well as advocating a harder line on immigration. Ahead of Trump's arrival in Davos, Gary Cohn, a US national economic advisor, said that Trump was coming to Davos to "reiterate that a prosperous America benefits the world." "When the United States grows, so does the world," he said. The official theme of this year's annual gathering is 'Creating a shared future in a fractured world.' The Merkel and Macron speeches will be closely watched by many political and economic observers with this theme in mind. aos/tr (Reuters, dpa)
