British Prime Minister Theresa May touted a "golden era" of UK-China relations as she touched down in the central Chinese city of Wuhan Wednesday, her sights set on her country's future outside of the European Union. Accompanied by a delegation of 50 British business leaders, May's visit will focus on hashing out new global trade links ahead of the UK's divorce from the European Union, slated for March 2019.

Li, in his opening comments, said that May's visit would "bring new fruits, which will further elevate the golden era in China-Britain relations." Bolstering ties with the world's second-largest economy has become increasingly urgent for the UK in the run-up to Brexit. May has pledged to take the country out of the EU's single market and customs union so that it can strike its own trade deals with major economies like China and the US, ideally by the time of the Brexit cutoff date. In 2016, trade between the two countries totaled 59 billion pounds (€67 billion, $83 billion), with the UK exporting just 17 billion pounds-worth of goods and services to China. By contrast, UK exports to the EU that year were worth 236 billion pounds, making up 43 percent of all the country's exports. China "is delivering a new source of capital that — with the appropriate safeguards in place — can help us to invest in the future of our country," May wrote in an op-ed in the UK's Financial Times newspaper earlier this week. "Together, that means a stronger British economy and more and better jobs for British workers."

The leak prompted May to promise lawmakers on Wednesday that they would receive an official analysis of the UK's final Brexit deal for approval. Parliament has already been assured that the terms for the UK's withdrawal from the EU would be subject to a vote. However, if lawmakers were to reject the terms of the Brexit agreement, it would leave the UK crashing out of the bloc with no future partnership in place. May urged not to turn blind eye to rights abuses While business sits at the top of May's agenda, the prime minister also said she would take the opportunity to discuss a range of other issues with Chinese officials, including the North Korea nuclear threat and climate change. However, May has already come under pressure to address the political situation in the former UK colony Hong Kong and human rights abuses on the Chinese mainland. In an open letter to the prime minister's office, former Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten warned the island was facing "increasing threats to the basic freedoms, human rights and autonomy" that its citizens were promised after its handover back to China in 1997. EU leaders agreed to negotiating guidelines during a summit in April that divided the talks into two phases. The first phase seeks to "settle the disentanglement" of Britain from the EU. Since talks began on July 17, negotiators have focused on three core issues: the "Brexit Bill," citizens' rights, and the Irish border. Brussels says London needs to continue paying into the EU budget after it leaves. The current budget expires in 2022 and EU officials want Britain to cover pensions and spending for EU loans and projects that it had committed to before triggering article 50. London has said it will honor its commitments, and both sides have reportedly agreed on a final bill of around £50 billion (€67 billion). The EU has said its citizens' rights in Britain is the "first priority" in the talks. It has proposed that the 3 million EU citizens currently in Britain and the 1.1 million British citizens in the EU keep their rights after Brexit. But that arrangement would give the EU's highest court, the ECJ, jurisdiction over EU nationals in Britain, an outcome British officials have said they want to avoid. Both sides have expressed their desire to avoid the return of a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, Britain's commitment to leaving the EU Single Market and Customs Union makes it difficult to avoid that. British and EU officials would need to monitor goods crossing the border to ensure they adhered to each other's separate customs rules. Talks can only proceed to phase two if the EU deems that "sufficient progress" has been made on phase one issues. According to EU guidelines, phase two talks should identify "an overall understanding on the framework for the future relationship" for the period after Britain has left. Major issues in this phase are set to be trade, immigration, and security. Theresa May has said Britain will leave the European single market, the bloc's free trading area, and the EU customs union, which sets a common EU tariff to third-country goods. Britain could then negotiate its own free trade deals and restrict EU migration. London also wants a new EU-UK trade deal, but with only 18 months left for talks, there is little time to negotiate one. May has also vowed to control EU migration into Britain after Brexit. However, some British lawmakers are wary that a sharp drop in immigration could lead to shortfalls in key sectors, including health, social care and construction. The EU has warned that single market access is out of the question if London decides to restrict the ability of its citizens to live and work in Britain. Recent terror attacks across Europe including a string in Britain underline both sides' support for continued security cooperation after March 2019. But access to EU institutions such as Europol and programs such as the European Arrest Warrant require compliance with EU laws. Whether Britain will still be compliant after it leaves is unclear. (Author: Alexander Pearson) Theresa May envisages a two-year transition period after March 2019, when Brexit talks conclude, and March 2021, when, supposedly, a new UK-EU trade deal comes into effect. How Britain will look during this transition remains unknown, but Brexit hardliners are unlikely to accept the UK remaining bound to the European Court of Justice (pictured) and paying its full share of the EU budget.
