Chinese human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng was detained by authorities, including a SWAT team, on Friday morning. His wife, Xu Yan, told DW that was leaving his Beijing apartment to walk his child to school at the time. Even several hours after Yu was taken into custody, Xu said her calls to local police had not provided her with any information about what happened to her husband. "I do not know what they are accusing him of or where he is," she said. Yu's arrest comes days after his license to practice law was revoked and just hours after he circulated a letter to journalists criticizing Chinese President Xi Jinping and calling for constitutional reforms.

"I am convinced that suggestions about changing the constitution are a part of freedom of expression, which is also a part of our constitution," Xu said.

"It's extremely worrying if he'll be charged with any serious crimes like 'inciting subversion of state power,'" Poon added. Yu, who was briefly detained in October last year, has long been a vocal critic of China's ruling Communist Party. He is best known for defending other prominent rights lawyers detained for supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, as well as for representing six attorneys who attempted to sue the Chinese government over the country's chronic smog problem. Yu's calls for reform On Thursday, Yu disseminated a letter calling for changes to China's state constitution, which included the introduction of multi-candidate presidential elections. "Designating the nation's president, as head of state, through a single party election has no meaning as an election," Yu wrote. "It has no power to win confidence from the nation, civil society, or the world's various countries."

His report was released as China's Central Committee debated introducing new constitutional reforms. However, critics luke Yu expect these to be based on the recommendations of President Xi, with the aim of consolidating his power. Crackdown on dissent Yu is the latest victim of the Xi's recebt crackdown on dissent, which has targeted all manner of people, from human rights lawyers to teachers and even celebrity gossip bloggers. More than 200 rights litigators and activists have been detained or questioned since 2015. The state's suppressive measures have been described by rights groups as "unprecedented." Last year, activist and Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo died of cancer while in detention after authorities rejected his request to seek treatment abroad. He was sentenced in 2009 to 11 years in prison for "subversion" after pushing for democratic reforms in the country. Eritrea ranks last in the World Press Freedom Index: there is no other country where press freedom is worse off than in the East African dictatorship. Reports from the disastrous state of affairs in Eritrea are rare, and many journalists have been forced to leave the country. Radio Erena is the only one to broadcast independent information to the people of Eritrea - from Paris. Press freedom is also non-existent in North Korea. Sealed off from the rest of the world, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un keeps a check on what the media publish. State TV and radio are available, nothing more. People who express their opinions vanish in political prison camps - along with their entire families. President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov owns almost all of the country's media corporations. The newspaper Rysgal is the only exception, and even here, every edition needs state approval before it can go to press. A new law against media monopolies gives the people of Turkmenistan access to foreign news, but the government still keeps tabs on the Internet, and blocks most websites. Independent media do not exist in Vietnam. The ruling Communist Party tells journalists what to publish. For the most part, publishers, editors and the reporters themselves are party members. Authorities have recently taken a greater interest in bloggers who challenge the authoritarian Communist Party's opinion monopoly - and try to silence them by sending them to jail. China, Reporters Without Borders says, is the world's biggest prison for bloggers and journalists. The authoritarian regime takes massive steps against unwelcome news coverage; pressure on foreign reporters is also on the rise. Entire regions are taboo to them, their work is closely monitored and Chinese assistants or interview partners can quite simply be imprisoned. Many journalists have been persecuted and killed since the uprising against Bashar al-Assad, whom Reporters Without Borders has ranked as an enemy of press freedom for years. The al-Nusra front, which fights against Assad, and the Islamic State group in turn attack Syrian state media reporters, kidnapping or publicly executing the journalists and correspondents.
