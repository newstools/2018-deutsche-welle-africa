The first launch of the year for French launch services firm Arianespace got off to a rocky start on Thursday, when mission control briefly lost contact with its rocket. The Ariane 5 rocket carrying two commercial satellites launched at 7:20 p.m. local time (2220 GMT) from the Kourou Space Center in French Guiana. Around an hour later, Arianespace CEO Stephane Israel announced that the controllers "lost contact" with the craft, saying it was an "anomaly." Read more: The perfect job?

Arianespace said a tracking station in Brazil was unable to track the Ariane 5 rocket shortly after the ignition of the rocket's upper stage. "This lack of telemetry lasted throughout the rest of powered flight," the statement said.
