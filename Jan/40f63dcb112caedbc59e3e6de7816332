It's the very last chance for nine European Union member states, whose representatives have been summoned to Brussels to explain how they intend to stop breaching EU air pollution levels. The environment ministers have a lot of explaining to do on January 30 when they face the EU's Commissioner for Environment Karmenu Vella. German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks is among those who have been called, after receiving a warning letter. If the commission is not convinced by their statements, it will take the breaching member states to court. The EU introduced limits for particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 2010. But many member states — especially in major cities — regularly have air pollution far beyond these limits. Read more:Stuttgart: Germany's 'Beijing' for air pollution? The German southern city of Stuttgart, for instance, has recorded levels of 82 micrograms of NO2 per cubic meter of air — that's twice as much as the allowed threshold of 40 micrograms. Showdown in Brussels "It's very good that Vella has summoned the ministers to Brussels and put pressure on them," said Anne Stauffer, of the Health and Environment Alliance, an umbrella organization of environment and health organizations concerned with the health effects of environmental changes in the EU. This problem had been known for a while, she added — what has been lacking is the political will to actually do something about it. The European Commission already addressed a dozen EU member states at the beginning of 2017, among them Germany, warning them to stick to EU limits. They are now potentially facing fines. Infringement procedures have already been initiated for Poland and Bulgaria, while Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Great Britain, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia have been allowed extra time to explain their case. Tuesday is their chance to explain to the commission how they intend to curb air pollution. And it's entirely up to the individual nations to decide how they do it, European Commission spokesperson Enrico Brivio told DW. "It's not up to us to dictate actions to be taken," he said. The commission will then discuss whether these actions are enough to suspend proceedings for now. Read a DW opinion: Car industry going from bad to worse? 'Empty-handed' German environment minister? Environmentalists doubt Germany's plans are going to convince the commission. "Hendricks is going to show up empty-handed in Brussels," said Dietmar Oeliger, head of transport policy at Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union Germany (NABU). In a letter sent to Vella on January 9, which DW has obtained, Germany's environment and transport ministries have already laid out plans to curb emissions: An "immediate action program for clean air 2017 to 2020" is supposed to do the trick.

But that's not going to be enough, according to Jens Hilgenberg of Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND). Although the program will have long- or medium-term effects, it won't ease pollution levels right away, he said. In order to stay within the limits, Germany would have to change technical components — or incentivize a change in its citizens' behavior, he added. 'Diesel problem hasn't been solved' Experts agree these high nitrogen oxide levels in Germany and other countries like France are due to cars running on diesel. Diesel trucks already have exhaust-scrubbing systems that actually work — as opposed to those in cars. "The diesel problem hasn't been solved yet," said Julia Poliscanova, manager of clean vehicles and air quality with the Brussels-based nongovernmental organization Transport & Environment. "It's really important to force car makers to improve the new Euro 5 and Euro 6 diesel models," she said. Many of these cars have been the most egregious emissions violations. "They have to refit these cars, or take the models off the market where that's not possible," she added. Read more: The trouble with diesel bans If Germany committed to such measures, this would have huge positive effects on air quality in all of Europe, Poliscanova added. "[Germany has] the largest automaker industry, and they also certify most of the cars for the EU market. They have the power to actually change something," she told DW, adding it was just a question whether the German government had the courage to stand up to the auto industry. If one were to decide against retrofitting, then a ban on driving diesel cars should be put in place, BUND's Hilgenberg said. 'Germany should lead by example' It's clear these changes won't happen overnight, said Stauffer of the Health and Environment Alliance, "but it's important the commission now gets the point across that this foot-dragging exercise is not going to fly."

This difference in price encouraged many citizens to buy a diesel car instead — which translated to even worse air quality. German politicians have been dragging their feet on such policies. "But an economically strong country like Germany should lead by example," said Saar. She hopes the commission will plan to follow through after the meeting on Tuesday. NABU's Oeliger agrees. "It would be fatal to suspend the proceedings — the European Commission needs to keep up the pressure, or it will lose credibility." Germany pays up — and that's it? If this infringement does make it to court, only then will be decided which fines member states have to pay, up to several thousand euros per day. "It could definitely cost a pretty penny." Stauffer doesn't believe Germany would take its chances. Until now, with similar infringement proceedings, there haven't been any fines — because the proceeding itself was enough to push for changes. "At least the public is now upping pressure by saying, 'Enough is enough!'" BUND's Hilgenberg is less optimistic. "Nothing has happened since the emissions scandal [in 2015]," he said. "New diesel cars which you can now buy at car dealerships are still not in line with emission limits. I do think it's entirely possible that nothing will change at all." Read more: Dieselgate: Green group grumbles over 'Mickey Mouse' summit Until now, the German government had decided to play the waiting game. And Hilgenberg doesn't rule out that Germany will keep playing that game. Air pollution causes more than 1,300 premature deaths per year in the Macedonian capital, according to official statistics. Particle pollution (PM) in Skopje is more than ten times higher than the air quality standards set by the European Union - both regarding PM10 - particles measuring less than 10 microns - and smaller PM2,5 particles, which can enter the lungs and even the bloodstream. The problem escalates every winter as a result of industrial emissions, smoke from wood-burning stoves and exhaust fumes from old cars. Macedonian authorities have announced a set of emergency measures aimed at fighting the high air pollution levels. Public transport is temporarily free for everyone. Pregnant women and people over 60 years of age are excused from work. Skopje’s public transportation system is underdeveloped, consisting only of buses. Many of these do not meet the most basic environmental standards. Bicycles are rarely used because the city lacks the necessary infrastructure and road traffic culture makes cycling a risky adventure, with accidents on an almost daily occurence. Local media reported that shops in Skopje have run out of anti-pollution masks as many residents are looking for protection from the polluted air. Local NGOs are alarmed: Pollution in Skopje is above average on 269 days per year, they warned, asking the government and local authorities to subsidize a series of measures which could improve air quality in the long term. Stuttgart, one of the most polluted cities in Germany, raises an alarm when the PM10 particles in the air reach 80 micrograms per cubic meter. In Skopje, the average for winter months is more than twice as high - around 200 - with peaks often reaching 600 micrograms of PM10 or more. Even geopolitical interests are involved in the fight against pollution. As the air pollution in Macedonia worsened, the US Embassy in Skopje asked for ideas via Twitter. "AirPollution in Skopje was so thick today, you could hardly see the embassy! What ideas do you have for cleaner air in #Macedonia?" It is not unusual for the US and other Western embassies in Macedonia to engage in such public stunts. But this time the answer came directly from Moscow… "As our friends from @usembassymkd are searching for ideas for the air pollution in Macedonia we want to help with a solution. #TurkishStream," answered the Russian embassy. Turkish Stream is a Russian pipeline which - if completed - should run from Turkey to Greece and Macedonia to reach other Eastern European countries. The US are pushing for alternatives for the energy supply in the region. As Skopje is located in a valley surrounded by mountains from three sides, the only viable solution for its residents during the winter months is to search for a getaway in the nearby highlands. Apart from the clean air, they can enjoy some spectacular views - with their pets. Author: Boris Georgievski
