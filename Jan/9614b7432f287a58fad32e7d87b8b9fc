Britain's business and political world was rocked by allegations of sexual harassment on Wednesday, after an investigation by the British Financial Times (FT) newspaper reported that female hostesses were groped and propositioned at a men-only charity gala. Around 360 businessmen and politicians attended the latest annual dinner and auction organized by the Presidents Club charity fund at London's luxury Dorchester Hotel. The event also featured more than 100 young female hostesses, who were required to wear short skirts and high heels. Among them were two undercover journalists, who later reported dozens of instances of harassment, lewd comments and "repeated requests to join diners in bedrooms elsewhere in the Dorchester."

"The worst I was told by one of the hostesses was a man taking his penis out during the course of the dinner," she added. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

The trust claimed to have raised some 20 million pounds ($28 million, €23 million) since it was founded in the 1980s. A number of institutions that had previously received donations from the trust, including London's Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital and London's Royal Academy of Music, said they would be returning all funds handed to them in recent years. Political figures scramble to distance themselves from gala A number of political figures were forced to issue statements distancing themselves from the charity gala, including UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. Among the auction prizes at the event was a personal lunch with Johnson and tea with Carney. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May said that Johnson "had not agreed to support this event and knew nothing of the inclusion of any lunch." The Bank of England released a statement saying that Carney was "deeply dismayed that such an event could take place" and that a tour of the central bank had been donated at a separate event and reauctioned for the Presidents Club's gala without permission. A member of May's cabinet, Children and Families Minister Nadhim Zahawi, came under fire for attending the dinner. May's spokesman said that he "has himself said that he felt uncomfortable at it, leaving at the point that the hostesses were introduced." Zahawi later added on Twitter that he "unequivocally condemns this behavior" and will "never attend a men-only function ever again." The ramifications of the event were felt by some in Westminster, however. Businessman David Meller was forced step down from his position on the board of the Department for Education for his role as a joint trustee of the Presidents Club.

Labour Party lawmaker Jess Phillips, who brought the issue before the House of Commons, said: "What happened is that women were bought as bait for men who were rich men, not a mile from where we stand, as if that is an acceptable behavior. It is totally unacceptable." "It is quite extraordinary to me that in the 21st century allegations of this kind are emerging," junior education minister Anne Milton told the house. "Women have the right to feel safe wherever they work and allegations of this type of behavior are completely unacceptable." Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
