US Vice President Mike Pence told Israel's Knesset on Monday that Washington was intending to bring forward a controversial plan by the Trump administration to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. "In the weeks ahead, our administration will advance its plan to open the US Embassy in Jerusalem — and the embassy will open before the end of next year," Pence said. The intention to move the embassy, which has been condemned by the Palestinians and their Arab allies, was agreed in theory by US lawmakers years ago but was set in motion by US President Donald Trump in December. Originally, the White House had suggested that the transfer would be completed by the end of 2020, when Trump's term comes to an end.

Lawmakers from the main Arab party in the Knesset boycotted Pence's speech on Monday in protest, with its leader, Ayman Odeh, describing the vice president as a "dangerous racist." In his speech, Pence, however, defended a move he said "recognizes fact over fiction — and fact is the only true foundation for a lasting peace." He said the US administration called on Palestinians to return to negotiations, adding that "peace can only come through dialogue." His exhortation is not likely to fall on fertile ground, with Palestinians saying the US is no longer an acceptable mediator for peace talks after its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Arab lawmakers protested against Pence in the Knesset and were later evicted 'Disastrous deal' Pence went on to say that the US would be withdrawing in the coming months from a landmark nuclear deal with Iran under which the Islamic Republic has curbed its production of enriched uranium in return for the lifting of sanctions. Trump has consistently slammed the deal, which has the backing of a number of US allies, including the European Union, Germany, the United Kingdom and France, both during his campaign and since taking office. Pence echoed his superior by calling the agreement "a disaster" and saying that the US administration would no longer certify it. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

"I have a solemn promise to Israel, to all the Middle East and to the world: the United States of America will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon," Pence said, garnering hearty applause from Israeli lawmakers. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is among the fiercest opponents of the nuclear accord, saying it creates the conditions to allow the Islamic Republic to acquire a nuclear weapon that could threaten Israel's existence. Pence is in Israel on a three-day visit as part of a Middle East trip. His speech to the Knesset was the first-ever by a sitting US vice president. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
