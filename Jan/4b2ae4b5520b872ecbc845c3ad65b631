Ireland's government will give voters their first chance in 35 years to decide whether to repeal the country's restrictive abortion laws, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar announced on Monday. A referendum on the divisive issue will be held at the end of May in the once-stridently Catholic country.

"I believe that this is a decision about whether we want to continue to stigmatize and criminalize our sisters, our co-workers and our friends or whether we are prepared to take a collective act of leadership to show empathy and compassion," Varadkar added.

A termination is legal only in rare cares when a woman's life is in danger. The law was changed following public outrage at the death of a pregnant woman in 2012 who was refused an abortion.

Others use abortion pills to end their pregnancies. How Ireland has modernized: The once powerful Catholic Church nowadays plays less of a vital role in Irish society, as witnessed by a 2015 referendum where Irish voters decided by a landslide in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage. What's likely to happen: If the latest opinion polls are anything to go by, more than half of Irish voters would support a repeal of the abortion ban, with a 12 week limit. Two recent surveys found 51 percent and 56 percent support. However, pollsters say those against the repeal are more likely to cast their vote. Age split: Pollsters have pointed to a sharp generational divide with a clear majority of voters over 65 opposed to lifting the ban. What date: Varadkar said the referendum would take place by the end of May, after pro-choice campaigners called for the vote to be held before students and young people go traveling for the summer. The exact date will be finalized in the coming weeks. Read more: Ireland votes 'yes' on same-sex marriage Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
