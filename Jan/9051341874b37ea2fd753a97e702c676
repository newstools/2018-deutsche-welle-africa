Human Rights Watch's annual report has urged governments across the globe to fight populism and xenophobia. Efforts to resist authoritarian agendas in some countries are starting to pay off, the human rights organization said. "The central lesson of the past year is that human rights can be protected from populist challenge," said Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch executive director. "What's needed is a principled defense rather than surrender, a call to action rather than a cry of despair," he added. France shines, Austria disappoints France, the report says, is the "most prominent example of successful resistance to xenophobic populism" from the country's Front National party, led by Marie Le Pen. President Emmanuel Macron had "very clearly positioned himself  and had offered alternatives to right-wing populism," HRW Germany Director Wenzel Michalski told DW.

By contrast, "where they tried to adopt their [the AfD's] rhetoric and also tried to oppose Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee-friendly policies, that's where the AfD got a lot of votes."

"Their hesitancy has left a vacuum in which mass atrocities proceeded, often unchecked, in countries such as Yemen, Syria, Burma, and South Sudan," the report said. Many EU countries were also sitting on the fence about populist policies in Turkey , Hungary and Poland, for example. But Roth emphasized that "the EU finally found its voice and invoked Article 7 [on Poland]," at a news conference in Paris on Thursday.
