"We have some good news," said Portuguese Finance Minister Mario Centeno, the new chief of the Eurogroup while announcing the agreement in Brussels. He added that the agreement "reflects the huge effort and excellent cooperation between the Greek government and the institutions." Monday's decision also puts Greece on track to exit its current bailout program when it expires in August this year. Afterwards, the country is expected to finance itself by directly borrowing from investors.

"The Greek authorities have over-achieved the fiscal targets set over the last three years," the Eurogroup said in a statement, adding that "Greek authorities have also continued to strengthen tax collection." Eurogroup head Centeno also said "technical work on debt relief measures" would also start soon. The IMF has previously called for Athens to be granted substantial debt relief, a position opposed by Germany which has pushed for a more austere path.

"People are now convinced that things have turned around, and people are beginning to talk about the future and Greece's exit from the program," he told reporters. Last week, the Greek parliament approved a batch of reforms which included tougher legal criteria for strikes and cuts in family benefits. The approval prompted a day of protests and walkouts that shut down public transportation. Monday's tranche of bailout money is expected to be given to Athens in two disbursements, with the first €5.7 billion expected to be disbursed in February and the remainder in April.
