This week's eco@africa travels from Uganda to Germany to bring you innovative ideas for a more eco-friendly world. First, we’re off to Ghana, which ranks among Africa’s largest gold producers. That’s taken a heavy toll on the environment, polluting rivers and farmland. But Partners of Nature Africa, a local NGO, is taking a stand by rejuvenating areas ravaged by gold mining. We then travel to Uganda to check out an innovative exercise bike which generates electricity as its users work up a sweat. After that, we have a chat with Catherine Mungai, a policy engagement specialist with CGIAR, to find out why, in Kenya, focusing on women is the key to helping tackle climate change. Next, we check out how a researcher in Germany has developed a way to make fertilizer more eco-friendly, and how Rwanda is dealing with its electronic waste. Finally, we visit Burkina Faso, where a company is bringing solar-based solutions to people in rural and urban areas who have no or little access to electricity. Check out the show and let us know what you think at ecoafrica@dw.com.
