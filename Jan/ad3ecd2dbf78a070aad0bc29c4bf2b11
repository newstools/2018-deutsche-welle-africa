The European Union is divided on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, which makes it impossible to lead an active Middle Eastern policy, Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung. Asselborn called on European nations to recognize the state of Palestine and urged Paris to set an example. "We Europeans must show that Palestinians also have a right to their own state," he said in the article published on Wednesday. "If France would lead the way by recognizing Palestine, other countries would follow, including Luxembourg." Ireland, Belgium, Slovenia are also reportedly ready to recognize the Palestinian National Authority as a full-fledged national government. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

Most of them, such as the Czech Republic, Poland, and Romania, took the step during the Cold War — long before joining the EU.

The move represents a strong signal to Israel's position that the divided city of Jerusalem — and not Tel Aviv — is the capital of the Jewish state. However, Palestinians also view East Jerusalem as their capital. The US has called on the EU to also recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government.

EU divided? However, six EU countries abstained during the symbolic UN vote to show opposition to Trump's move on December 21st. Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Latvia all refrained from rebuking the US, joining other American allies such as Canada and Australia.

However, the Czech Republic decided against moving their embassy to Jerusalem. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians reportedly seek to explore these divisions in their diplomatic struggle. Several weeks ago, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Brussels to meet with EU's foreign ministers, and Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas is scheduled to do the same on Monday. Palestinian sources claim that their officials are negotiating with several EU states about officially recognizing Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital, in order to balance out the US move.
