Carles Puigdemont, the fugitive ex-president of Catalonia, wants to attend the next session of the regional parliament on Tuesday but avoid being arrested in the process. He has sent a letter to the Catalan parliament asking the body to guarantee his right to attend the parliamentary session without being taken into custody. Puigdemont fled to Belgium following an illegal declaration of independence last October. It's unclear if the chamber even has such authority but a couple of court rulings suggest Puigdemont faces long odds of returning to Spain and getting elected regional president without getting arrested along the way. As the world watched, Catalonia's parliament voted 70 to 10 for the region to declare its independence from Spain. "Our legitimate parliament has taken a very important step. This is the people's mandate," Puigdemont said after the decision. Dozens of opposition lawmakers from the Socialist Party, Citizens Party and Popular Party had walked out of the parliament chamber to boycott the vote. Within an hour of the Catalan vote, the Spanish Senate in Madrid passed a bill to trigger Article 155 of the Spanish constitution. The measure will allow the central government to suspend Catalonia's autonomy. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would sack Catalonia’s government and set new regional elections for December 21. European leaders were quick to condemn the independence declaration. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the Union "doesn't need any more cracks," while EU Council President Donald Tusk said Madrid "remains our only interlocutor." Leaders in Germany, France, Italy and the UK voiced their support for Madrid. The US also chimed in, saying "Catalonia is an integral part of Spain." Barcelona and Madrid had been in a standoff since 93 percent of voters opted for Catalan independence in an October 1 referendum marred by police violence. Spain said the poll was illegal and stressed the low voter turnout of 43 percent. It subsequently threatened to suspend the region's autonomy if Catalan leaders did not stop their drive for independence. Many had expected tensions to ease on October 26 when Catalan President Carles Puigdemont was expected to call snap elections to bow to a key Spanish government demand. But Puigdemont refused, saying that he did not have enough "guarantees" from Madrid. Instead, he called on the Catalan parliament to decide on how to respond to Spain's threat to suspend the region's autonomy. Tens of thousands of pro-independence protesters had taken to the streets of Barcelona ahead of the independence declaration to demand the region's secession and the release of two leaders of pro-independence organizations, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez. Independence has divided Catalonia. Many who supported continued unity with Spain refused to vote in the October 1 referendum. The pro-independence crowds outside the Catalan parliament immediately rejoiced after hearing the independence declaration. Many people were draped in the "Estelada" flag associated with Catalan independence. Some reportedly called for the Spanish flag to be removed from the Catalan government palace as regional lawmakers arrived from the parliament. (Author: Alexander Pearson) Author: Alexander Pearson Spain's Constitutional Court ruled Saturday that Puigdemont must be present at the parliamentary session in order to get re-elected president. The high court has also ruled that Puigdemont must get the court's permission to attend the session, although he appears to be the only official candidate for regional president. Puigdemont initially planned to do that but on Monday his lawyer said that was unlikely. His attorney, however, did not rule out Puigdemont's attendance at the meeting. But here, too, the Constitutional Court has ruled that the parliamentary session would be invalid if Puigdemont attends without the court's approval. Previously a Spanish judge ordered Puigdemont's arrest on possible rebellion and sedition charges. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

Thousands of companies have relocated their legal headquarters to other parts of Spain due to the uncertain political situation in Catalonia. In the latest election held in December, separatists won a majority of seats — 70 out of 135 — but not a majority of votes , a sign of the political divisions across the region. Madrid has vowed to extend its rule over Catalonia should the separatists try to install Puigdemont as regional president while he is abroad. Currently, three other Catalan separatists remain in jail, others have been freed on bail and five more are in self-imposed exile to avoid arrest. The separatists' parliamentary majority gives them incentive to seek some sort of compromise, as a stalemate would eventually lead to new elections, which could threaten their outright majority Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

For now the Catalan parliament looks to have two months to agree on a presidential candidate for the province. bik/rt (AP, Reuters)
