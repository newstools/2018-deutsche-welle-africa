In complete darkness the four ascended 1,200 meters (3,940 feet) without a fixed rope to Nanga Parbat's 6,700 meter level to pluck Revol to safety and evacuate her with Pakistani helicopter assistance on Sunday. "No one did such a climb before, Shad said."Most people, it takes two or three days, and they did it in eight hours in the darkness." Revol and her Polish climbing companion, Tomasz Mackiewicz, had called for help on a satellite phone on Friday from 7,400 meters up the mountain Crawling on the peak Pakistan Alpine Federation top official Karrar Haidri said rough weather had prevented the quartet from also reaching Mackiewicz who had been spotted crawling while Revol attempted to climb down. An online campaign to "crowdfund" the rescue bid for Revol and Machiewicz reportedly raised some 112,000 euros ($140,000). Nanga Parbat, in northern Pakistan, is the world's ninth-highest peak at 8,125 meters (26,600 feet). Since a first successful climb in 1953, more than 30 climbers have died trying to climb it, including a Spaniard and an Argentinian lost, presumed dead last year. The four volunteer Polish rescuers are still seeking to become the to climb K2, the world's second highest peak, in winter. ipj/aw (AP, AFP, Reuters)
