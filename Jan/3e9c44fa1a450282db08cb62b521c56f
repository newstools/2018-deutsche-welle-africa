Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Wednesday said the country's first elections since the end of Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule would be held before July this year. "Next month I will be able to make a proclamation of elections, so I believe that elections will not be in July, they will be earlier than July," Mnangagwa said speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

"We want to have free, fair, credible elections, free of violence," 75-year-old Mnangagwa said, adding that he would welcome international observers. "If you have that criteria, why would you want to deny international observers coming into our country? The EU ... I would welcome them." Zimbabwe 'open for business' Mnangagwa told the World Economic Forum on Wednesday that Zimbabwe was "open for business." Under Mugabe's rule, government spending increased drastically and was partly used as patronage. More than 90 percent of the budget went towards civil servant salaries, which left little for investment needed to boost growth.

"Mnangagwa has been at Mugabe's side for 50 years. He was considered to be Mugabe's fixer." Mnangagwa gained notoriety for allegedly directing the infamous operation "Gukurahundi" in the 1980s, in which North Korean-trained elite soldiers fatally targeted perceived government dissidents from the country's Ndebele ethnic group. An estimated 20,000 people were killed. law/ls (AFP, Reuters)
