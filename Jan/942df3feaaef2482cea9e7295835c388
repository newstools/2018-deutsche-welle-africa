Social media sites drastically improved their response time for online hate content in 2017, new European Commission figures showed on Friday. Tech companies said the self-regulation success showed legislative responses - such as Germany's controversial new hate speech laws - were unnecessary.

EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said the results made her less likely to push for legislation on the removal of illegal hate speech, but warned tech companies not to rest on their laurels. "I would expect similar commitment from IT companies when it comes to other important issues such as terrorist content or unfair terms and conditions for users," Jourova told dpa.

From drawn out court cases to blanket bans, DW examines how some countries try to stop the circulation of illicit content while others attempt to regulate social media. After a public debate in Germany, a new law on social media came into effect in October. The legislation imposes heavy fines on social media companies, such as Facebook, for failing to take down posts containing hate speech. Facebook and other social media companies have complained about the law, saying that harsh rules might provoke unnecessary censorship. In 2014, the European Court of Justice ruled that European citizens had the right to request search engines, such Google and Bing, remove "inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive" search results linked to their name. Although Google has complied with the ruling, it has done so reluctantly, warning that it could make the internet as "free as the world's least free place." In May, Ukraine imposed sanctions on Russian social media platforms and web services. The blanket ban affected millions of Ukrainian citizens, many of whom were anxious about their data. The move prompted young Ukrainians to protest on the streets, calling for the government to reinstate access to platforms that included VKontakte (VK), Russia's largest social network. In 2015, the European Court of Justice ruled that Safe Harbor, a 15-year-old pact between the US and EU that allowed the transfer of personal data without prior approval, was effectively invalid. Austrian law student Max Schrems had launched the legal proceedings against Facebook in response to revelations made by former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, Edward Snowden. In China, the use of social media is highly regulated by the government. Beijing has effectively blocked access to thousands of websites and platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest. Instead, China offers its citizens access to local social media platforms, such as Weibo and WeChat, which boast hundreds of millions of monthly users. Many politicians and media outlets blame Russia's influence for Donald Trump's election victory in 2016. Moscow reportedly used Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Instagram to shape the public opinion on key issues. In October 2017, Twitter suspended over 2750 accounts due to alleged Russian propaganda. The platform also banned the ads from RT (formally Russia Today) and the Sputnik news agency. With social media under pressure for allowing the alleged Russian meddling, Facebook announced a new project to combat such efforts in November 2017. The upcoming page will give users a chance to check if they "liked "or followed an alleged propaganda account on Facebook or Instagram. Author: Lewis Sanders IV (dj) Why are social media companies voluntarily policing content? Several European governments were pushing social media companies to tackle extremist online content. In a bid to avoid legislation, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube signed a code of conduct with the European Union in May 2016 to review most complaints within a 24-hour timeframe. Instagram and Google+ will soon join them. Why is Brussels pushing for self-regulation? The Commission fears a patchwork of rules in the EU and the possibility that governments could abuse such laws to restrict freedom of expression. What is happening in Germany? Starting this year, social media companies Germany face fines of up to €50 million ($61.2 million) if they fail to remove hate content in a timely manner. The laws have been criticized for encouraging social media firms to err on the side of censorship. Read more: Germany implements new internet hate speech crackdown What happens next?
