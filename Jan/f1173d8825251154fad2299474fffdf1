Deutsche Welle: Mr Lauterbach, are you pleased SPD delegates voted to begin coalition talks with the CDU/CSU? Karl Lauterbach: I'm glad we got this result. I think this was the most important party conference in over 15 years. The result implies a certain responsibility for those of us who participated in the exploratory talks and will take up official coalition negotiations. And it motivates us to drive a hard bargain in the upcoming talks. Otherwise our party members won't accept the final deal. Germany's SPD has voted to start formal talks for a new "grand coalition" with Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU. For many, the narrow vote has demonstrated that Schulz still has to prove he's the right person to lead the party. (21.01.2018) Germany's Social Democrats have voted to enter coalition talks with Angela Merkel's conservatives. DW examines the common ground reached between the parties in preliminary talks. (21.01.2018) Germany's SPD has voted for coalition talks with Angela Merkel's conservatives. But that does not necessarily mean that a coalition government will come about. (21.01.2018) The SPD party conference has concluded with a vote to begin official coalition talks. Yet the party remains divided, and worse still, its leadership now appears weak after the close results, says DW's Sabine Kinkartz. (21.01.2018) DW: The SPD appears to be deeply divided. Does that make it hard to conduct coalition talks? KL: I don't think the party is divided. I think it merely expressed different opinions. Not every difference of opinion automatically equates to a deep rift. This can also bring us together. I think we're the only party that is able to have this kind of open debate without the tone getting nasty or personal. So I don't believe we're divided. I think both sides can live with this result. DW: When do you think will Germany get a new government? KL: I think it will be and shouldn't be more than a matter of weeks. We have to be able to govern and must make that clear. And incidentally, I think we can no longer come across to voters as self-absorbed and caught up in internal voting until we're satisfied. Citizens expect progress and we need to deliver.
