Last week's preliminary agreement between Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) makes the perspective of a renewed "grand coalition" more likely for Germany's government. With a grand coalition, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) would officially become the largest opposition party in parliament. According to established rules, this allows the party to have a member in every parliamentary committee, which is a structure allowing the opposition to challenge the government's policies. The AfD is also set to obtain a leadership role in at least two of the parliamentary committees. Read more: What is the role of Germany's parliamentary opposition?

According to information obtained by the German daily FAZ on Tuesday, the AfD has nominated two of its members for the position, Marc Jongen and Martin Renner. Olaf Zimmermann, manager of the German Cultural Council "Since its establishment in 1998, the Parliamentary Committee on Cultural and Media Affairs has developed a leading role in promoting Germany's Holocaust remembrance culture," said Cultural Council head Olaf Zimmermann in a statement. Members of the AfD have sparked controversy for making anti-Semitic statements and are renowned for their stance against Muslim refugees. Zimmermann said it would be a "fatal signal" to allow the party to preside over this committee.
