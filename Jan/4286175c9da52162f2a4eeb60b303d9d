Ronaldinho, who won the 2002 World Cup with Brazil and the 2006 World Player of the Year award, is retiring from football, his brother and agent Roberto Assis said Tuesday. "Ronnie's professional career is over," Assis told The Associated Press news agency. "He wants to be a football ambassador, do charity, and work with his friends in music from now on." The announcement brings a definitive end to the former Brazilian and Barcelona midfielder's celebrated career. The 37-year-old last played in a competitive match in 2015. Assis suggested his brother may play in some farewell matches, including one with the Brazil national team. "We're going to do something pretty big, something cool, after the World Cup in Russia, probably in August," he said.
