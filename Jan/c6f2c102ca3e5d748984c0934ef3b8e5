A new Twitter probe has identified an additional 1,062 Russian-linked accounts that circulated fake news ahead of the US presidential election in 2016. The social media giant said it had uncovered a total of 3,814 accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, a Saint Petersburg-based company that his widely seen as a "troll farm" with links to the Russian government. Over the 10-week time span prior to the November 2016 election, the accounts posted 175,993 tweets, roughly 8.4 percent of which were election-related. Twitter said it also found an additional 13,512 automated bot accounts that were directed by Russia, taking the total number of identified bots up to 50,258. Twitter, along with fellow tech giants Facebook and Google, has come under increasing scrutiny for allowing the spread of fake news ahead of the US elections, as well as votes in dozens of other countries. Twitter to alert exposed users In a bid to remedy the damage, the company said it intends to notify some 670,000 users who engaged with any content posted by the accounts in question. "Any such activity represents a challenge to democratic societies everywhere, and we're committed to continuing to work on this important issue," the company said in a statement.

Founder Mark Zuckerberg said in an online post that the social network would seek to "prioritize news that is trustworthy, informative, and local." Zuckerberg added: "There's too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today. Social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don't specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them."

"We could try to make that decision ourselves, but that's not something we're comfortable with," Zuckerberg said. The move comes a week after Facebook announced that its next major feed update would prioritize content from friends and family on the network, over posts from media organizations and advertisements. The tech giant said the change was part of its refocus on "community" and admitted it could see users spending less time on the site. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
