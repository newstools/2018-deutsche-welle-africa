Despite some early setbacks in the opening set on account of Hsieh Su-wei's unorthodox shot selection, Germany's Angelique Kerber managed to overcome her frustrations and avoid suffering the fate of Garbine Muguruza, who had been knocked out of the first Grand Slam of the season by the Taiwanese player in the second round.

I was running everywhere and she always had an answer. I was everywhere," the former champion said after sealing a quarterfinal berth. Though the final set saw Hsieh save two match points on her serve, Kerber comfortably served out the seventh game to set up a quarterfinal tie with Madison Keys -  the American having made easy work of eighth-seeded Caroline Garcia of France 6-3, 6-2. "It definitely made me realize how much I love it and how much pressure I put on myself. Missing this last year, I feel like I'm playing without pressure and just going out and playing my game," Keys said after her fourth-round victory.

"He was not completely the unknown opponent that maybe people thought he was," the 36-year-old Swiss said. "He hung with me for a long time. So it was a good match." Roger Federer has been in fine form in the Australian Open and is yet to drop a set. This is the 14th time that Federer has reached the final eight at Melbourne Park and the 52nd time that he's featured at this stage of a Grand Slam. His opponent in the quarterfinals, will be power-hitter Tomas Berdych, who beat Fabio Fognini in straight sets 6-1, 6-4, 6-4.

"The injury is still there. I feel it but I'm trying not to think about it and give it everything," she said. The top seed is guaranteed to meet a Czech opponent for a place in the semifinals, either sixth seed Karolina Pliskova or Barbora Strycova, the 20th seed, who were to play later in the day. jt/pfd (Reuters, AP)
