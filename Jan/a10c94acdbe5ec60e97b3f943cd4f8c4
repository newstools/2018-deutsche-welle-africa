A Paris court on Wednesday began the trial of 31-year-old French citizen Jawad Bendaoud, to determine if he actively conspired in helping two of the jihadists involved in the November 2015 Paris terror attacks hide out or whether he was unknowlingly caught up in events. Bendaoud is on trial alongside his friend Mohamed Soumah and Youssef Aitboulahcen, the brother of the woman killed in a police raid on his apartment.

Bendaoud—a native of the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis with a long criminal record—is accused of lending his apartment to a senior "Islamic State" (IS) jihadist Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who is suspected of coordinating the attacks that killed 130 people,  and his accomplice Chakib Akrouh. The attacks were the deadliest in France since WWII.

"Someone asked me for a favor, I helped them out," he said, adding that all he knew was that they were from Belgium and wanted access to water and a place to pray. "If I'd known, do you really think I would have hosted them?" Bendaoud said. A huge manhunt for the men had been launched at the time.

Abdeslam was arrested in Belgium four months after the attacks and transferred to France, where he has since refused to cooperate with investigators. Around 15 people are in custody or being sought by police as part of the French probe into the Paris attacks which has taken investigators to Belgium, Morocco and Turkey. jbh/law (AFP, AP)
