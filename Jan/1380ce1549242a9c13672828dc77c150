A confidential report prepared for the British government and leaked on Monday suggests all UK industries will be hurt by leaving the European Union, Buzzfeed News reported. The findings are the latest embarrassment for British Prime Minister Theresa May's government, which has faced renewed criticism from other EU leaders about the lack of a coherent Brexit strategy.

A department spokesperson said: "We have been clear that we are not prepared to provide a running commentary on any aspect of this ongoing internal work." Asked by Buzzfeed News why the report was not being made public, the source answered: "Because it's embarrassing." But staunch euroskeptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who campaigned for Britain to vote to leave the EU, dismissed the report's findings as scaremongering, telling the BBC's Newsnight program that similar predictions made prior to Brexit were "highly speculative" and "very inaccurate."

EU Ministers said the UK could keep its membership benefits for a further 21 months, but said the British government could not bloc or have input on new EU laws during the transition. May's future uncertain: Already severely weakened by the lack of a parliamentary majority following a snap election last year, British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing a new revolt from MPs within her ruling Conservatives, as bitter divisions over the possible roadmap to Brexit continue to dog the party.

In the months after, the British pound fell sharply against the dollar and euro, and while the UK economy grew 0.5 percent in the final three months of 2017, annual economic growth was at the weakest rate since 2012 at 1.8 percent. London's booming property market has dipped over the past 12 months and last October's collapse of the fifth biggest airline, Monarch, together with the liquidation of outsourcing services group Carillion earlier this month, were both partly blamed on Brexit. The report's findings could strengthen the case for the softest possible Brexit or a second referendum on EU membership after negotiations with Brussels have concluded.
