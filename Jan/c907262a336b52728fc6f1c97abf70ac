Hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees from sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East have been rescued at sea in recent years and taken to ports in southern Italy, Spain and Greece. Migrants charged thousands Migrants remain vulnerable to human traffickers who charge them thousands of euros to board often overcrowded, unseaworthy boats that set off from Libya and other countries for Europe. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 3,116 migrants died or went missing in Mediterranean waters last year. The provisional count for 2018 is 206.
