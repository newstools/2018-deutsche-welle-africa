Former champion Angelique Kerber won her first round match of the 2018 Australian Open against Anna-Lena Friedsam Tuesday in Melbourne Park. The 2016 Australian Open winner beat fellow German Friedsam 6-0, 6-4 to win her tenth match in a row this season. Kerber will celebrate her 30th birthday on Thursday with a match against either Nao Habino or Donna Vekic in the next round. "I'm feeling good and trying to continue how I have played in the last few weeks," she said after the game. "I'm just trying to enjoy it again on court." Zverev wins, Raonic loses Alexander Zverev began his campaign with a match on the Rod Laver Arena against Italy's Thomas Fabbiano, winning 6-1, 7-6, 7-5. Canada's Milos Raonic was the surprise exit of the day after he was beaten by Slovakia's Lukas Lacko. The 30-year-old won in four close sets 6-7, 7-5, 6-4, 7-6. Novak Djokovic returning from injury and seeded 14 was playing his first match since Wimbledon last July as he strolled to victory against Donald Young of the US 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. Stan Wawrinka has also not raised a racket in match play since Wimbledon and, though he was taken to four sets against Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis, looked relatively untroubled in a 6-3, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7/2) win.
