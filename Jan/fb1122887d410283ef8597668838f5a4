Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told reporters on Wednesday that he would launch proceedings to shut the fraternity down. The decision follows an outcry over revelations the group "Germania zu Wiener Neustadt" used a songbook that praised the Holocaust and other the atrocities committed by the Waffen SS and Nazi paratroopers. The scandal deepened after it emerged that a lawmaker from the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), Udo Landbauer, had until recently served as the fraternity's vice-chairman.

On Tuesday, the center-left opposition Social Democrats confirmed that one of their members, who allegedly illustrated the songbook, was among the suspects. The man had been expelled from the party. According to media reports, one of the songs in the book, printed in 1997, included the lyrics: "Step on the gas, old Germanics, we can make it to seven million." An estimated 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust during World War II, many of them in gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps.
