The embattled government of Yemen said on Sunday that separatists from the country's south were trying to launch a coup in the interim capital of Aden. President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi called on the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi rebels to intercede on this new front in the conflict, and beseeched the separatists to engage in a temporary ceasefire. "Based on instructions from President Hadi, supreme commander of the Yemeni armed forces, and after talks with the Arab coalition ... you must order all military units to cease fire immediately," Prime Minister Ahmed bin Dagher was quoted by French news agency Agence France-Presse as saying. The government also ordered its own troops "to return to base," following fierce clashes across Aden. Medics on the ground told Reuters that at least 10 Yemeni fighters were killed and 30 wounded in the fighting. Proxy war The southern port city has been used as a temporary capital by Hadi's internationally recognized government since it was ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014. With the development of southern separatistsÂ taking up arms, a new dimension has been added to the complex conflict. Ostensibly a civil war, the fighting in Yemen has taken on the characteristics of a proxy war pitting Saudi Arabia, which supports Hadi, against regional rival Iran, which backs the Houthis. The separatists are allied to the United Arab Emirates. The conflict has had disastrous humanitarian consequences, causing thousands of civilian deaths and leaving hundreds of thousands on the verge of starvation. es/cl (AFP, Reuters)
