The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees urged for donor countries to speed up their funding on Tuesday to ensure services could continue after US President Donald Trump slashed funding to the organization. Eleven countries have already taken steps to send their donations early, said Commissioner General Pierre Krähenbühl of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).

Krähenbühl also made an emergency appeal on Tuesday for over $800 million (€645 million) to provide assistance to 5 million Palestinian refugees and their descendants in Gaza, the West Bank and Syria. The UNRWA provides the Palestinians with food, water, shelter, medical assistance and educational programs. "The Agency's critical financial crisis following the reduction in US funds threatens our ability to deliver these vital services," the Krähenbühl said. The agency had a budget of over $1 billion last year with the US contributing one-third of the total. In mid-January, the Trump administration announced it would only give $60 million this year, coming up far below last year's $360 million.

Krähenbühl said the agency has not yet received specifics about the reforms, saying that he believed the US decision was politically-motivated and not based on the agency's performance.

"This has to be part of the debate that took place around Jerusalem." The Trump administration controversially moved to recognize the city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital in early December, sparking protests around the world. Palestinians, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, froze ties with the Trump administration earlier this month, saying Washington could no longer be the main mediator in peace talks. In his appeal for aid, Krähenbühl underscored the "imperative to preserve and ensure that humanitarian funding is preserved from politicization." According to the Old Testament, David, king of the two partial kingdoms of Judah and Israel, conquered Jerusalem from the Jebusites around 1000 BC. He moved his seat of government to Jerusalem, making it the capital and religious center of his kingdom. The Bible says David's son Solomon built the first temple for Yahweh, the God of Israel. Jerusalem became the center of Judaism. The Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (3rd from the left) conquered Jerusalem in 597 and again in 586 BC, as the Bible says. He took King Jehoiakim (5th from the right) and the Jewish upper class into captivity, sent them to Babylon and destroyed the temple. After Persian king Cyrus the Great seized Babylon, he allowed the exiled Jews to return home to Jerusalem and to rebuild their temple. Since the year 63 CE, Jerusalem was under Roman rule. Resistance movements rapidly formed amongst the population, so that in 66 CE, the First Jewish–Roman War broke out. The war ended 4 years later, with a Roman victory and a renewed destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. The Romans and Byzantines ruled Palestine for approximately six hundred years. Over the course of the Islamic conquest of Greater Syria, Muslim armies also reached Palestine. By order of the Caliph Umar (in the picture), Jerusalem was besieged and captured in the year 637 CE. In the following era of Muslim rule, various, mutually hostile and religiously divided rulers presided over the city. Jerusalem was often besieged and changed hands several times. From 1070 CE onward, the Muslim Seljuk rulers increasingly threatened the Christian world. Pope Urban II finally called for the crusade. A total of five Crusades set out to conquer Jerusalem within 200 years. In 1244, however, the crusaders finally lost control of the city and it once again fell under Muslim rule. After the conquest of Egypt and Arabia by the Ottomans, Jerusalem became the administrative seat of an Ottoman administrative district in 1535. In its first decades of Ottoman rule, the city saw a clear revival. With a British victory over Ottoman troops in 1917, Palestine fell under British rule. Jerusalem went to the British without a fight. After World War II, the British gave up their Palestinian Mandate. The UN voted for a division of the country in order to create a home for the survivors of the Holocaust. Some Arab states then went to war against Israel and conquered part of Jerusalem. Until 1967, the city was divided into an Israeli west and a Jordanian east. In 1967, Israel waged the Six-Day War against Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Israel took control of the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. Israeli paratroopers gained access to the Old City and stood at the Wailing Wall for the first time since 1949. East Jerusalem is not officially annexed, but rather integrated into the administration. Israel has not denied Muslims access to its holy places. The Temple Mount is under an autonomous Muslim administration; Muslims can enter, visit the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent Al-Aqsa mosque and pray there. Jerusalem remains to this day an obstacle to peace between Israel and Palestine. In 1980, Israel declared the whole city its "eternal and indivisible capital." After Jordan gave up its claim to the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1988, the state of Palestine was proclaimed. Palestine also declares, in theory, Jerusalem as its capital.
