Europskeptic Milos Zeman (above) would win 45.5 percent of the Czech presidential election run-off, against 45 percent for the pro-Brussels centrist Jiri Drahos, with about 10 percent still undecided, pollster Kantar TNS and Median agencies said on Friday. The Czech Republic is at a crossroads, with the two candidates articulating rival visions of Europe, Zeman's vehemently euro-skeptic and anti-immigration and Drahos far more pro-Brussels oriented. Drahos attacked Zeman as "a representative of the past political era [...] a symbol of division" in the final debate on Czech Television on Thursday. Zeman said Drahos, a newcomer to politics, "has no idea" about the "craft you have to learn for a long time." Jiri Drahos, presidential candidate, voting during the first round of Czech presidential elections in Prague Brussels or Moscow? Zeman supports billionaire prime minister Andrej Babis's euroskeptic ANO movement, which won October's election, winning 78 seats in the 200-seat parliament, but has since been shunned by potential coalition partners. Babis's minority government lost a vote of confidence on January 16, although Zeman on Wednesday asked Babis to form a new cabinet and Babis has said he will name his cabinet before his term ends on March 8, regardless of the outcome of the presidential vote. Immigration a key issue Immigration has become a key issue in the campaign. The Czech Republic has received only 12 migrants under the EU quota system, but billboards across during the campaign read: "Stop immigrants and Drahos. This is our country. Vote Zeman!" Zeman's stance is similar to other populist EU-skeptic politicians in Warsaw and Budapest. He has also called on the EU to lift its sanctions on Russia. Drahos meanwhile ran using the slogan "Decency is a strength." Electoral demographics Zeman tends to represents low-income, lower education, rural voters, while Drahos’s support based tends to come from wealthier, better-educated urbanites. jbh/rc (AFP)
