Germany's Angelique Kerber thrashed US Open finalist Madison Keys 6-1, 6-2 on Wednesday to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open. Making a mockery of the 21st seeding she landed after a miserable 2017, the former world number one outplayed the American in almost every facet of the 51-minute match to seal a semi-final date with Simona Halep. "It's always tough to play against Madison," said Kerber, who also won the US Open in 2016. "I was just playing my game, I was not thinking a lot about winners or errors, I was staying in the moment and trying to play every single point."

Keys held in the fifth game of the first set, but the German went on another roll to lead 3-0 in the second set. Keys slowed the momentum by holding and then getting her first service break of the match, but Kerber responded quickly to finish it off in 51 minutes. She broke Keys six times in total in the match and now has a 7-1 record against the American. Clash of contrasts The match was billed as a classic contrast of styles, the big-serving power game of Keys versus the scurrying, chase-everything-down, all-action approach of Kerber. For Keys, it was another disappointing loss in a major. She reached the US Open final last September but lost in straight sets to Sloane Stephens.

Kerber, who celebrated her 30th birthday last week, is now guaranteed to return to the top 10 in the rankings even if she goes no further at Melbourne Park. "I'm really enjoying my tennis, I'm really enjoying being on court," she added. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
