Kurdish Germans and their supporters turned out in the tens of thousands in the city of Cologne on Saturday to protest Turkey's military intervention in northern Syria. The anti-war protests were relatively peaceful, though sporadic clashes broke out between the 20,000 demonstrators and police over the use of flags depicting Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Disputes over the contested flag led to at least three arrests. Cologne has seen a number of pro-Kurdish rallies in recent months, but Saturday's was the first called in direct response to the Turkish government's decision to join the ground war in Syria near the city of Afrin, a Kurdish area with little to no "Islamic State" (IS) presence. Hundreds of Kurdish fighters have since been killed in Afrin, causing Germany's Kurdish umbrella group NAV-DEM to call the nationwide protests.

Although flags representing Ocalan/the PKK were explicitly banned, there was some confusion over whether demonstrators could carry flags supporting the mostly Kurdish Syrian militia known as YPG. Arguments between protesters and police over their use of flags prompted police to order a stop to the march when it was only halfway through its planned route in downtown Cologne, with huge tanks for water cannons at the ready.

Left party lawmaker Katja Kipping wrote on Twitter as she prepared to take the stage, "the electricity's been turned off, the stage blocked. Banned from giving a speech against Erdogan's war in Afrin."
