The United States placed the head of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh (pictured), on a terrorist blacklist on Wednesday. "Haniyeh has close links with Hamas' military wing and has been a proponent of armed struggle, including against civilians," the US State Department said, adding that he had been involved in terrorist attacks targeting Israelis and Americans. The decision bars the 55-year-old from financial transactions with American citizens and companies and freezes any assets he may have in the United States. Read more: What are Fatah and Hamas? 'This decision will not deter us' Hamas, which has been on a US terror blacklist since 1997, brushed off the announcement as a "failed attempt to pressure the resistance." "This decision will not deter us from continuing the resistance option to expel the occupation," it said, referring to Israel's formal occupation of Gaza since 1967. The Islamist organization has fought three armed campaigns against Israel since 2008. Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 after ousting rival Palestinian group Fatah. Since then, Hamas leaders have had a fraught relationship with the Fatah-dominated leadership of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

He said the announcement "crossed every red line" and called on Palestinians to resist it: "This Zionist policy supported by the US cannot be confronted unless we ignite a new intifada." Bloody protests erupted for days after the announcement in many Palestinian territories as well as some Middle Eastern countries.
