Venezuelan security forces engaged in a deadly shootout Monday with a rogue police pilot and his supporters that left at least two people dead. Oscar Perez grabbed international headlines last year after he allegedly seized a helicopter, flew it over downtown Caracas, and fired on government buildings to protest the government's violent crackdown on demonstrators. The country was rocked by violent protests last year in response to a deepening economic crisis and the government's crackdown on democracy. The Interior Ministry released a statement Monday, which said, members of a "terrorist cell" were killed and five others captured. It was not immediately clear if Perez was among those killed, but state television reported that two police officers were gunned-down during the firefight, and five more seriously injured. Perez is wanted for using a stolen helicopter to fly over downtown Caracas and lob grenades and small-arms fire on government buildings, including the Interior Ministry and Supreme Court last June.  He is also accused of breaking into a National Guard unit in December and stealing weapons. President Nicolas Maduro's left wing government has described Perez as a "fanatic, extremist terrorist." A manhunt has been under way since the summer. In addition to being a trained officer, Perez is an actor, pilot and dog trainer. That eclectic background has prompted some Maduro critics to question whether Perez's attacks were staged in cahoots with the government to justify a further crackdown on the opposition.

Filming while under fire Police finally tracked down Perez in the poor hillside neighborhood of El Junquito on the edge of the capital. Despite the firefight with police Perez managed to post videos of the attack on social media while under fire. "We're wounded ... they're killing us!" said Perez in one video, apparently wearing a bulletproof vest. Gunshots were heard in the background as he appeared to be in a crouched position inside a small house in one video. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

Now only you have power so that we can all be free," he said in an earlier video, staring into the camera and telling his children he loves them and hopes to see them again. In another video, a bloodied Perez said, "They are firing at us with grenade launchers. We said we are going to surrender but they do not want to let us surrender. They want to kill us." Opposition politicians called for due process Monday, after news broke of the gun battle and arrests. "There is no death penalty in Venezuela," tweeted opposition lawmaker Yajaira Forero. "We demand that Mr. Oscar Perez's right to life be respected. If he committed a crime he must be judged by a court, as the law establishes."
