Just in time for the grape harvest across much of Europe, we have some extraordinary wines to present. “Black wine” is a Malbec from the town of Cahors in southern France, which is so thick and dark you can’t see through it. And we have a special Riesling from the Mosel wine region in Germany. The grapes grow on slopes with a high slate content, which gives the wine its mineral notes. Along with several awards! And have you heard of the Croatian wine that ages on the Mediterranean sea floor? A nice glass of wine is so much more than a drink – it’s an experience. Where’s your favorite place to enjoy a glass of wine, and who with? Send us a photo, we’d love to hear from you! As a thank you we’re giving away a wristwatch in an exclusive euromaxx design. Closing date is 14 September 2018, 12 noon UTC. All decisions are final. Good luck!
