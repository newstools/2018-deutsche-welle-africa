From saving rare plants to making drinking water with the sun, this week's eco@africa show is packed with exciting projects from across Africa and Europe! First up, we have a look at an eco-friendly carwash in Cameroon which uses minimal water and is powered by solar energy. After that we go to Austria and visit a unique farm that is preserving and distributing rare seeds for edible plants. Back in Africa we visit Birds of Eden in South Africa's Eastern Cape. It is a sanctuary for injured and lost birds and is currently the home to roughly 3,500 different species. Then we have a look at water. First by seeing how a new innovation from the company Marine Tech could help during water shortages and second by looking at the ancient techniques used by some of Mali's farmers to protect their crops and the environment. Finally, we visit a creative fashionista who is making useful items from recycled rubber and plastic. Her brand, Ghetto Wardrobe, is not only cool it's good for the environment. Check out the show and let us know what you think at ecoafrica@dw.com!
