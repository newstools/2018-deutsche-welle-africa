The exhibit at Berlin's central Alexanderplatz square shows bodies that have been preserved through a method known as plastination, which drains them of fluids before replacing them with silicone. The process allows the skinned bodies of humans and animals to be exhibited in life-like poses. "The museum can continue to exist," Rurik von Hagens, the creator's son, told. A spokesman for the court also confirmed the settlement, saying the museum had agreed to announce the arrival of new exhibits two weeks in advance to give the council Berlin-Mitte time to determine the origin of the specimens. Under the table, a poker player hands over a card with his foot - a scene from the "Body Worlds" Gunther von Hagens' touring exhibition of preserved human bodies, "Köperwelten" or "Body Worlds," has been displayed in different locations around Germany and the world since 1996. is/ks (dpa)
