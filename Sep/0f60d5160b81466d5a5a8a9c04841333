The meeting at the Black Sea city of Sochi is the second in less than two weeks between Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin, after they failed to strike a deal over Idlib in a meeting in Iran earlier this month. Turkey is seeking to avert a widely anticipated Syrian regime offensive on Idlib, the last rebel stronghold where more than 3 million civilians are at risk.

Turkey has carved out two enclaves in to the north and east, backing rebels there and setting up local administrations. Ankara hopes to return some of the 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey to these territories. Erdogan has asked Russia and Iran for time to try to isolate HTS and turn rebel factions against the terrorist group in a bid to prevent a Syrian regime offensive. It also wants to maintain and expand its buffer zone inside Syria.
