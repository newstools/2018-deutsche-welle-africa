Two German federal police officers and a member of a voluntary citizens' security force are under investigation for incitement after a witness saw them making the Nazi salute and uttering racist comments outside a pub in the southern city of Rosenheim, Bavarian police said on Saturday. In a statement, the police said that the comments made by the three men were "table talk" and occurred under the influence of alcohol. No details of the comments were given, with police saying that more witnesses were being sought. Far-right infiltration?
