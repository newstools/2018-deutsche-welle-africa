Two people were killed in southern China, authorities said. 'Severe and extensive' Mangkhut was packing winds of up to 160 km/h (100 mph) as it battered Hong Kong on Sunday, causing high-rise buildings to sway and water to surge into the streets. Authorities described the damage as "severe and extensive," with more than 300 people injured. In nearby Macau, severe flooding was reported and the enclave's casinos shuttered for the first time in history.
