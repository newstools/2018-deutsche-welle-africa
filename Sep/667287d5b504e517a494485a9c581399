After a first exhibition at Berlin's Willy-Brandt-Haus in 2015, a new show featuring Vivian Maier's photographic work opens on Tuesday as part of the city's Long Night of Photography. It runs through January 6, 2019. The Vivian Maier exhibition is also one of the events of the program of the European Month of Photography, billed as Germany's largest photo festival. From September 28 through the end of October, 500 artists can be discovered at 120 locations and through 300 events. New prints Titled "Vivian Maier. In her own hands," the exhibition features recently printed photos from John Maloof's collection. Maier's work was only made famous posthumously by Maloof, a Chicago real estate developer who had acquired around 100,000 negatives and slides kept in storage. The story of his effort to track down and try to better understand the secretive street photographer was told in his 2013 Oscar-nominated documentary, Finding Vivian Maier. The picture gallery above also looks back at Maier's unusual story.
