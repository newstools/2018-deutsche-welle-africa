A passenger ferry on the southern end of Tanzania's Lake Victoria sank near Ukara Island on Thursday, killing at least 100 people, a government agency said. The death toll is expected to rise on Friday as rescue efforts resume at dawn. The Tanzania Electrical, Mechanical and Electronics Services Agency, which is in charge of maintaining the country's ferries, said that hundreds of people are still missing and called for patience. Authorities were able to rescue 37 people on Thursday after the passenger ferry MV Nyerere went down just meters from the dock. Hundreds still missing It is unknown just how many passengers were onboard, yet vessels on the lake are often overcrowded. The ferry was also reportedly carrying cargo. George Nyamaha, head of the Ukerewe district council, said, "There were more than a hundred people onboard when the ferry sank, it is feared that a significant number lost their lives." The Tanzanian government has said that as many as 200 people may have drowned in the accident. The incident is not the first of its kind in Tanzania. At least 145 people were killed in 2012 when a ferry sank off the semi-autonomous island of Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean. In 1996, at least 500 people were killed when a ferry went down near the same spot as Thursday's capsizing on Lake Victoria. rs, js/sms (AFP, Reuters)
