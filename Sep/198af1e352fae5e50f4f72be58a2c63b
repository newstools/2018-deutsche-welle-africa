This week's eco@africa show travels from Cameroon to Nigeria, packed full with innovative ideas for a greener world! Our first stop is Zanzibar, where swimming with dolphins is a huge tourist draw. But as tourist numbers rise, dolphin numbers are sinking. So an NGO is monitoring the creatures, trying to make sure that dolphins are protected and that tourism is sustainable. Next we visit Germany, where pollution, dams and poaching have critically endangered the sturgeon fish, which have been around for more than 200 million years – and which a project is now trying to save. Then we're off to Nigeria to meet energy entrepreneur Sulaiman Yusuf, who is developing what he calls 'off the grid' homes that offer residents an eco-friendlier energy alternative to the state energy network. Switzerland is our next stop – here, landscape architect and tree collector Enzo Enea has created an open-air museum to exhibit special trees. We then check out how efforts to save South Africa's vultures are getting on – not only are they hunted for traditional African medicine, they are also poisoned by poachers. Finally we meet eco hero Ismael Essome Ebode, who makes unique plastic boats in Cameroon by tying plastic bottles together - helping the environment by using bottles that would otherwise choke the country's drainage system.
