A 19-year-old Afghan asylum-seeker was taken into custody Friday after stabbing three people in Ravensburg's town center, according to a statement from police. The victims — two Syrian asylum-seekers aged 19 and 20, and a 52-year-old German man — were taken to the hospital. One of them is reportedly in a critical condition. Authorities said the motive for the attack wasn't clear, adding, however, that they had ruled out terrorism. Police blocked off parts of the southwestern town for much of the afternoon as experts interviewed witnesses and examined the scene. Two of the victims were found at a bus stop near one of the city's main squares, while the third was about 50 meters (54 yards) away.
