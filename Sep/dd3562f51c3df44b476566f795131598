From tackling food waste to protecting wildlife, this week's eco@africa show is packed with exciting projects! First up we ask, what does the future hold for Africa's national parks? There are hundreds of parks across the continent but they face pressure from many corners. Next up we head to the Congo where poaching, deforestation and overpopulation have endangered the habitat of many of the country's gorillas. Ever wondered what it is like to be a ranger in a national park? We speak to Johnson Maoka at Pilanesburg National Park in South Africa to find out what the challenges of doing the job are. Next we are staying in South Africa but heading to the sea. With corals around the globe facing extinction, a team of marine biologists are hoping the country's coral reefs could be a safe space in a changing climate. Do you find yourself wondering what to do with your left over coffee grounds? Entrepreneur Ralph Haydl from Nuremberg shows us how he collects coffee grounds from cafes and turns them into a package to help grow mushrooms. And finally we head to Uganda, where access to clean water in rural areas can be a struggle. We see how one social enterprise is trying to change that by distributing new water filters to local schools. Checkout the show and let us know what you think at ecoafrica@dw.com!
