Project goal: GIZ wants to promote a more climate-friendly kind of air conditioner on Grenada and Carriacou. The effort is part of the IKI-project "Cool Contributions Fighting Climate Change" Project implementation: Among other things, the project supports partner countries' efforts to remove obstacles to the use of natural cooling agents and propellants Project partners: Ministry of Finance, Planning, Economic Development, Trade, Energy and Cooperatives, Grenada,International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) Project scope: Aside from Grenada, the project area also encompasses Costa Rica, Iran, Vietnam and Philippines, and is supported by BMU with a total of €4.7 million ($5.5 million) Project duration: From Januray 2016 to June 2021 The Carribean heat on Grenada and Carriacou makes air conditioners a popular addition to the home. Though they traditionally have poor green credentials, there are now efforts to make the devices more environmentally friendly by using propane as a natural cooling agent. But the gas is highly flammable, meaning installation and maintenance require special knowledge and skills on the part of technicians, something they often lack — until now. A film by Katja Döhne
