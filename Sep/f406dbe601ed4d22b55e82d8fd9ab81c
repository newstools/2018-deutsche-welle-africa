Germany on Thursday handed back a pre-Columbian gold funeral mask to Peru, the Peruvian Culture Ministry said. The eighth century Sican mask was handed over to the Peruvian embassy in Berlin by Bavarian authorities. I'm happy to receive one of the most emblematic assets from the north Peruvian cultures, the Sican Mask," said Patricia Balbuena in a statement. Peru reported the mask as missing in 1999, and it was then confiscated by Interpol in the western German city of Wiesbaden. The Munich regional court ordered the mask be returned to Peru in December 2016 after it had been confiscated by the public prosecutor.

Peru's neighbor Ecuador saw the return of 13 pre-Columbian artefacts from a private German collection in July, following a six-year legal battle.
