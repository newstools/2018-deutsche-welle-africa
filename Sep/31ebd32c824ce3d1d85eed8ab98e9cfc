Moscow is analyzing the assassination of Alexander Zakharchenko, the commander of pro-Russian separatists and head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday. The deadly Friday blast was "an open provocation, aimed at disrupting the fulfillment of the Minsk Accords," Lavrov told reporters, referring to the 2015 peace deal. "Although, truth be told, the Ukrainian authorities were not fulfilling them anyway," Lavrov added.
