The fantasy series "Game of Thrones" took home television's top honor on Monday night, winning the best drama category at the 70th Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. HBO's mega hit took home a total of nine awards, the most out of all other nominated shows. Amazon's sitcom about an unhappy housewife who performs standup comedy, "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," took home both the crown for best comedy series, the best comedy actress for Rachel Brosnahan, as well as best supporting actress in a comedy for Alex Borstein. It was the first time an online streaming service won the top award in the comedy category, with the show winning a total of eight awards throughout the night. Claire Foy from Netflix's "The Crown" and Matthew Rhys of "The Americans" won the top awards for best drama acting. In a landmark win, "RuPaul's Drag Race" took home the award for best reality competition. The show, which sees drag queens compete to become "America's next drag superstar," has garnered widespread praise for highlighting LGBT stories and drag culture. The night saw a series of upsets, but also several snubs to people of color despite having the most ethnically-diverse pool of nominees in the award show's history. Despite having 16 nominations, Donald Glover's "Atlanta" went home empty handed on Monday — although the show won two awards at the Creative Arts Emmy's last week. Expectations were high for the show to become the first black-led comedy in 33 years to win the best comedy series since "The Cosby Show" in 1985. Hopes were also high for Sandra Oh from "Killing Eve" to become the first actor of Asian descent to win the Emmy's top drama acting award, but lost out to Foy.
