The governor of California, Jerry Brown, announced Saturday that his state would join the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg in a sister-state relationship with the goal of strengthening climate protection and economic ties between the two. The sister-state agreement comes at the tail end of a global climate summit organized by Brown, which attracted thousands of politicians, activists, business leaders and others from around the world. The premier of Baden-Württemberg, Winfried Kretschmann, joined Brown at the summit in San Francisco for the signing of the agreement. Previous joint cooperation on climate change issues led to the sister-state relationship. California and Baden-Württemberg, Germany's third-largest federal state, launched the Under2 Coalition in 2015, an international climate partnership committed to battling global warming.

"The fact that this little Under2 Coalition has grown shows you that from small beginnings we get very large outcomes, as long as we keep persevering." On the visit and the sister-state agreement, Kretschmann celebrated the deepening ties that now bind it with California. "We are proud to have California as a new partner at our side. Not only in the fight against climate change but also to shape new partnerships in e.g. science, culture, art, transportation & urban infrastructure," Baden-Wüttemberg's government said in a tweet. Brown has been one of many US politicians who has continued to implement measures to tackle climate change, despite President Donald trump's reversal in policy last year, when he announced the US withdrawal from the historic 2015 climate accord reached in Paris. jcg/sms (dpa, AFP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
