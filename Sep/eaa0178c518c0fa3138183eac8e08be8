Following more than 13 years at the helm of Daimler, Dieter Zetsche is expected to quit in May 2019, the company said Wednesday. He will be succeeded by the current head of development at the group, Ola Kaellenius, a 49-year-old Swede. Following a two-year absence, Zetsche is then expected to take over as head of the firm's supervisory board from Manfred Bischoff whose tenure ends in 2021.

Daimler and the wider German car industry is experiencing a delicate period as it suffers the fallout from the dieselgate emissions cheating scandal. European carmakers must adapt to new, tougher emissions rules, while bans on older diesel vehicles are looming in many German cities.

After many years trailing domestic rival BMW, Mercedes-Benz regained the crown of the world's top seller of premium cars.
