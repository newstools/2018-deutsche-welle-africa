Cocaine worth some €30 million ($35 million) has been confiscated from a container in the northern French port city of Le Havre. On Friday, customs impounded 752 kilograms of the narcotic, which had arrived on a ship from South America. France 3 TV Normandy cited a customs source as saying the discovery was made during a routine check of containers from abroad. The Agence France-Presse news agency said no arrests have been made yet. French Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin praised customs officials for their "exceptional" haul. Customs at Le Havre seized 3.5 tons (3,175 kilograms) of cocaine last year, according to an annual police report on trafficking.
