A 90-year-old woman sent a Leverkusen police station into lockdown after entering the building holding a Russian grenade from the Second World War. Unbeknownst to the pensioner, the device was live. "My husband brought the grenade back from the war in 1943," police quoted the woman as saying. "It's been sitting on a desk at home ever since."
