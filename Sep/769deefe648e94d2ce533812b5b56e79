Police in Griesheim, a town south of Frankfurt, said Saturday a masked robber walked into the gas station, put a plastic bag on the counter and demanded money from the cashier late Friday night. The 34-year-old cashier said the threatening appearance of the man made him carry out the instruction and he put several hundred euros into the bag. The man took it and walked off into the night. While the police came and searched for the robber, the man returned to the gas station two and a half hours later and dumped the money on the front door. He then walked off again, into the night. His motive for the robbery, and the return of the cash are unknown. Police have started an investigation. shs/jm (AFP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
