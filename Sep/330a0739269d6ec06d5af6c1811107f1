On September 15, 2008, the Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following a huge exodus of clients, the collapse in its stock price and the devaluation of assets by credit rating agencies. Its filing for bankruptcy was the largest in American history. Lehman's involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis played a key role in the subsequent financial crisis.
