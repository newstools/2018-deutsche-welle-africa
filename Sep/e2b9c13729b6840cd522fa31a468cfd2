A ferry on the southern end of Tanzania's Lake Victoria sank near Ukara Island Thursday, killing an unknown number of people. Authorities say the passenger ferry MV Nyerere went down just meters from the dock. It is unknown just how many passengers were onboard, yet vessels on the lake are often overcrowded. The ferry was also carrying cargo. George Nyamaha, head of the Ukerewe district council, said, "There were more than a hundred people onboard when the ferry sank, it is feared that a significant number lost their lives." The Tanzanian government has said that as many as 200 people may have drowned in the accident. Rescue missions have been halted until dawn on Friday. Ukerewe District commissioner Colonel Lucas Magembe said that 44 people were confirmed dead. And authorities report that 26 people were rescued Thursday. The incident is not the first of its kind in Tanzania. At least 145 people were killed in 2012 when a ferry sank off the semi-autonomous island of 

Zanzibar Â in the Indian Ocean. In 1996, at least 500 people were killed when a ferry went down near the same spot as Thursday's capsizing on Lake Victoria. js/msh (AFP, Reuters)
