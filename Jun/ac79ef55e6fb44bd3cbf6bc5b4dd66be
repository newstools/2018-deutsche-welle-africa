Scandal-hit social media giant Facebook apologized on Wednesday after it revealed that a software glitch had made some of its users' posts public for several days in May.  Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said the software changed the default privacy setting for new posts from private to public for some 14 million users between May 18 and May 27. The company identified the problem on May 22, but it took five days to reset the privacy setting for all of the affected posts. Read more: Shall I stay or shall I go now?
