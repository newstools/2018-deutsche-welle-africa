Since 1972, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has identified over 200 national parks and reserves that are considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. Once a year, the World Heritage Committee meetsÂ to update the list, paying special attention to endangered world heritage sites. In 2018, the Committee removed the Belize Barrier Reef from the List of World Heritage in Danger, but added the Lake Turkana National Parks. Worldwide, more than a dozen of these protected ecosystems are under threat by illegal poaching, extensive agriculture and a lack of conservation.
