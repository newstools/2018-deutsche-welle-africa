According to Anadolu, authorities accuse Mehmet Kanter of having contacted 120 suspects with alleged links to Gulen, including dozens who are said to have communicated through an encrypted messaging application. Mehmet Kanter is a former professor who was expelled from public service and imprisoned for five days in the summer of 2017 over his ties to Gulen. Kanter's whereabouts are not known, but US sports broadcaster ESPN reported that he is not currently in Turkey, citing his son's manager, Hank Fetic. The Turkish government believes that Fethullah Gulen is behind the attempted military coup in 2016 against Erdogan's government. More than 50,000 people have been arrested in Turkey under a state of emergency that was declared after the coup, for allegedÂ ties to Gulen. The Turkish government has said that the crackdown was necessary to fight alleged acts of terror.
