The Catalan government will still have to provide a monthly spending report to the central government, Celaa told reporters after the first Cabinet meeting since Socialist Party (PSOE) Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez came to power last week. Madrid had been supervising Catalan finances since 2015 to ensure no public money was funding illegal pro-independence activities, but controls were tightened by the conservative government of Mariano Rajoy in September 2017.
