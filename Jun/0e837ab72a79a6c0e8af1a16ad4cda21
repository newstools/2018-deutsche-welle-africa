An electrical short-circuit plunged Hamburg Airport into darkness Sunday morning, bringing air traffic to a halt at one of the largest air hubs in Germany, and forcing hundreds of travellers to evacuate the two terminals. The power went out at around 10 a.m. (0800 GMT/UTC). By afternoon power still had not been restored, forcing the cancelation of all air traffic for the remainder of the day. "The airport is forced to suspend flight operations for the rest of today. It was not possible to correct the error," they said in a statement. By early evening officials were still unable to say when the airport would be back in operation, or even when power might be restored. Stranded passengers in Hamburg A message posted on the airport's web site read: "Due to a power failure incident the airport is currently closed. Please contact your airline." Planes en route to Hamburg were diverted to nearby airports, like Hanover 150 kilometers (93 miles) to the south. Hamburg averages about 200 incoming and outgoing flights on a Sunday, and handles more than 17 million passengers per year. Jenny Webber was among those stranded at the airport. She had been set to fly to Copenhagen when the power went out. Her luggage had already been checked in, he said, "Otherwise I would have taken the train by now." bik,es/rc (AFP, dpa, AP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
