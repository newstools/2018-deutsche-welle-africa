This week's eco@africa kicks off with two brothers who founded a solar lamp production company to light Africa in a greener way. Lagazel's Burkina Faso branch made it one of the first to industrialize solar light production in Africa. Then join us on the shores of Spain, where the strong waves near the town of Mutriku are being put to good use thanks to a wave power plant that turns kinetic energy into electricity. The plant now provides power to more than 200 homes. After that we are heading to another coastline, this time in South Africa, to check out an eco-campaign striving to keep the country's Robberg Beach clean and protect its marine environment. The campaign is part of the Blue Flag programme, the international accreditation system for clean coasts. In Kenya, we dig into the impact of the cut flower business. The country is the fourth largest exporter of cut flowers - but it has a cost. At Lake Naivasha, huge numbers of fish have been killed by pollutants. We speak with the many Kenyan flower farms now working more sustainably. Next we see how in Ethiopia, a Swiss foundation has set up plant nurseries to prevent soil erosion and combat deforestation. Positive effects can already be seen: barren fields are becoming fertile again and dry springs are refilling. Finally, we head up to Morocco to visit the Barbary macaques under threat due to their popularity among tourists and as pets. We see how one project in the country is working to save the endangered species by returning captured animals to the wild. Check out the show and let us know what you think at ecoafrica@dw.com!
