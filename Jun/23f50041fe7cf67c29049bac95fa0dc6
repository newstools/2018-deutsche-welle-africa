A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada.  Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged "a large quantity" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between €2,500 and €50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks.

There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing "shame" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges.  aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)
