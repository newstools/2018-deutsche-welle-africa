The exhibition Gerhard Richter: Abstraction is held from June 30 through October 21 at the Museum Barberini, a new space that opened last year in a rebuilt palace in the historical center of Potsdam.  The show presents 90 of the German artist's works, spanning from the 1960s to this day.   The focus of the exhibition is abstraction — a leitmotiv in Richter's oeuvre, explains museum director Ortrud Westheider.

Among them are black-and-white photographic pictures, color boards, as well as his grey paintings and abstract paintings from the late 1970s.
