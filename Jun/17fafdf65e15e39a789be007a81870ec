"It is simply stunning that this is said by the leader of a supposedly civic party." Marco Buschmann, parliamentary manager of the FDP parliamentary group in the Bundestag, told the Funke Media Group: "Any politician who deliberately tries to minimize the Nazi dictatorship and the Holocaust gives an indication of how sinister the visions he has for Germany are." AfD faction spokesman Christian Lüth responded on Twitter: "Bird shit is what I think of the Nazi era," if you take into account the 1000-year-history of Germany.
