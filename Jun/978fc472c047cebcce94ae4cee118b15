A German police officer shot a man in Berlin Cathedral on Sunday, German media reported, although the circumstances of the incident remained unclear. Footage posted online showed armed police officers cordoning off the area around the Cathedral – one of Berlin's most popular tourist attractions — with two ambulances parked at the entrance. Police later said that they had shot at a man "rampaging" in the church, and that he had been injured in the leg. They described the man as a "hooligan," who was "acting aggressively," but said there was no reason to suspect terrorism. "Based on what we know so far, we have no information that the suspect in any way had a terrorist or Islamist motive," a police spokesman said. The suspect was a 53-year-old Austrian man, according to German news agency DPA. He was taken to a local hospital, as was an officer who was "severely wounded" in the crossfire. The cathedral lies in central Berlin on the city's famous Museum Island. Witnesses said that armed officers were patrolling the area. es/rc (AFP, AP, dpa)
