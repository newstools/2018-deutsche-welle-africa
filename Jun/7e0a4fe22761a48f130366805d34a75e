This week on eco@africa we once again travel across Africa and Europe to bring you the latest and most innovative ideas to help make our world a greener place. We start in Morocco, where Fatima Zahra Beraich, a 31-year-old engineer has developed a simple process to make biogas which could pave the way for farmers to turn away from expensive propane gas. It's a sustainable and cheaper way for rural farmers to run their farms. After that we see how a solar-powered machine can help small-scale farmers in Nigeria cut agricultural waste while at the same time improving their livelihoods. Then we head over to Rwanda to have a look at single-use plastic bag recycling, before shopping at a Food Assembly in Germany. Finally, we visit a special orphanage in Liberia that is looking after young chimpanzees and preparing them to be released back into the wild. The West African chimpanzee is critically endangered due to poaching and the loss of habitat and this is a small step to help save them. All this and much more! Check out the show and let us know what you think at eco@africa.com.
