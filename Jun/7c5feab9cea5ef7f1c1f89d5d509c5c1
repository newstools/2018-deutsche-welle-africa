On Friday one photojournalist was attacked. The two-day rock concert, which goes into Sunday night, is the largest right-wing extremist rock festival in Germany. Last year it drew nearly 6,000 people. Around 300 counter-demonstrators gathered near the rock concert grounds. Politicians from the Social Democrats and the Greens were among those joining counter-demonstrations. Counter-demonstrators unfurled banners reading "Nazis out" and "Your ideology kills." They also placed 20 white crosses into the ground near the rock festival site to symbolize the victims of neo-Nazi violence. Since 1990, 193 people have been killed in right-wing violence. Many counter-demonstrators and politicians were disappointed that the courts did not prevent the rock fest. The courts allowed the event and even undid a strict alcohol ban. Right-wing extremist rock concerts are often registered as political events and are therefore protected under the constitution. Figures from the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) attended and spoke at the event.
