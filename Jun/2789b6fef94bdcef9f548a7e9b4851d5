Hamburg Airport will reopen at 6 a.m. on Monday after an electrical short-circuit plunged the airport into darkness Sunday morning. The blackout brought air traffic to a halt at one of the largest air hubs in Germany, and forced hundreds of travellers to evacuate the two terminals. "We are happy to announce that our airport will be open for operation at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT). Thanks to our technicians!" a post on the airport's official Twitter account early Monday read. A second tweet said the check-in counters would be open from 5 a.m. The airport said its technicians had worked under "high pressure" to fix the power failure, but did not give an explanation for why the outage had been so severe. The power went out at around 10 a.m. (0800 GMT/UTC). By afternoon power still had not been restored, forcing the cancellation of all air traffic for the remainder of the day. "The airport is forced to suspend flight operations for the rest of today. It was not possible to correct the error," they said in an earlier statement. Stranded passengers in Hamburg A message posted on the airport's website at the time of the blackout read: "Due to a power failure incident the airport is currently closed. Please contact your airline." Planes en route to Hamburg were diverted to nearby airports, such as Hanover, 150 kilometers (93 miles) to the south. Hamburg averages about 200 incoming and outgoing flights on a Sunday, and handles more than 17 million passengers per year. Jenny Webber was among those stranded at the airport. She had been set to fly to Copenhagen when the power went out. Her luggage had already been checked in, she said, "Otherwise I would have taken the train by now." bik,es,law/aw (AFP, dpa, AP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
