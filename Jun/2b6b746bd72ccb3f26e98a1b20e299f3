The United States has evacuated several diplomats from China after tests revealed they could be suffering from the same mystery symptoms reported by US diplomats in Cuba in 2017.  At least two of the people sent home reported "hearing strange noises in China," according to the New York Times. A medical team had arrived in China earlier in the week to screen the officials and their families after a government employee became ill with "subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure" in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in May.

In 2017, 24 diplomats and their family members left Cuba after suffering from unexplained symptoms including dizziness, headaches, cognitive issues, and visual problems. Some of the injuries, which also affected 10 Canadian diplomats and their families, resembled brain trauma. The US said its officials were the victims of "specific attacks," but has not yet blamed anyone for being responsible. amp/bw (dpa, AFP, AP)
