Police in southwest Germany said on Monday that they seized 646 kilos (1,425 pounds) of drugs, including a record 49,500 tabs of LSD, during a raid against a suspected international drug ring earlier this year. Police seized the drugs, which also included hashish, ecstasy and amphetamines, in January at two separate locations in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The LSD haul amounted to Germany's largest ever seizure of the illegal drug. Prosecutors said the drugs' street value was about €9.8 million (11.4 million dollars).

Police went on to identify a total of 11 suspects and believe the ring has been active across Europe, smuggling drugs to and from Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.
