A scientific expedition team from the Spanish Alnitak marine research center caught sight of a great white shark near Spain's Balearic Islands on Thursday. Alnitak Director Ricardo Sagarminaga said the shark sighting took place some eight miles (12 kilometers) off the coast of the island of Cabrera, south of Mallorca. "There had been possible sightings in recent years that were not confirmed, but this is the first scientific confirmation of the presence of a white shark in Spanish waters in at least 30 years," Sagarminaga said in a statement on the organization's Facebook page. All 10 crew members, who hail from five different countries, aboard the expedition's ship Toftevaag, saw the great white shark. Filmmaker and biologist Fernando Mirones posted a photo of the sighting, saying that the group would soon publish a video as well. Local newspaper Diario de Mallorca said it was a "historic sighting," as it represented the first time that proof of a live specimen in the Balearic Sea has been brought forth.

The Alnitak 2018 expedition bumped into the shark as its ship was roaming the coast of Mallorca to carry out various research activities, like gathering data on marine animals and microplastic pollution at sea.
