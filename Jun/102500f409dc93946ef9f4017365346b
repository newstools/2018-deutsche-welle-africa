This week we have a special edition of eco@africa. Like every week we travel across Africa and Europe to bring you the latest and most innovative ideas to help make our world a greener place. But this time we have a special focus on insects. We start off in Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique. There researchers are having a closer look at the thousands of insect, lizard and frog species and their huge role in the ecosystem. After that we meet with Sunday Ekesi from the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Kenya. He answers our questions about what benefits insects actually bring and how global warming is impacting them for the worse. Then we head to Germany to see how a biologist has been breeding insects for decades to fight against plant pests. And yet although convinced of the value of his tiny army, he doesn't believe feeding the world is possible without the additional use of pesticides. Finally, we take food out of a "solidarity fridge" in Paris and visit Ghana's Wash King. All this and much more! Check out the show and let us know what you think at eco@africa.com.
