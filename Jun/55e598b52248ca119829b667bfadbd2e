Paul McCartney's first album in five years is due out on September 7, but two tracks have already been released, a peppy pop song called "Come on to Me" and the ballad "I Don't Know." While there is little explicit connection to Egypt, McCartney has described it nonetheless as a kind of musical travelogue. "Egypt Station starts off at the station on the first song and then each song is like a different station. So it gave us some idea to base all the songs around that," he said in a statement. "I think of it as a dream location that the music emanates from." The statement said that the album emits a "travelogue vibe," kicking off and ending with instrumental tracks surrounding songs that form a "kaleidoscopic journey through myriad musical locales and eras, yet firmly rooted in the here and now." A burst of energy The album's name is taken from one of McCartney's paintings, which depicts sunflowers and animals under a blue sky. The musician turned painter has been prolific over the years in his visual art, having shown his work for the first time in 1999 in Siegen, Germany. The former Beatle recorded the Egypt Station in Los Angeles and Britain with Greg Kurstin, the US producer famous for co-writing Adele's mega-hit, "Hello." It will include 14 tracks, including the titles "Happy With You," "People Want Peace" and "Despite Repeated Warnings." The album is McCartney's first since 2013's New, which boasted a variety of younger producers and fresh sounds. The musician, despite having turned 76 on Monday, has celebrated a burst of energy in recent years that has included a global tour throughout 2016 and 2017. However, he told Rolling Stone magazine two years ago that it would be "unimaginable, and unseemly" to keep performing when he is 80. als/eg   (AFP, dpa)
