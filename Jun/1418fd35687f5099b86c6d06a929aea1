Officials in Mannheim, a university town at the confluence of the Rhine and Neckar rivers in western Germany, want to boost the city's nightlife — and to do that they're hiring a so-called "night mayor" to get the job done. But amped-up party antics inevitably bring with them a host of problems, including noise and litter, that disturb others. So, in addition to promoting the party scene, the night mayor will be tasked with resolving such conflicts "It doesn't matter if it's about noise or litter on the streets, the 'night mayor' should have conversations with residents and pub and club owners to develop common solutions," Matthias Rauch, who is responsible for the city's cultural development, said recently.
