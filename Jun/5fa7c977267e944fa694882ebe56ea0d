German Chancellor Angela Merkel is planning a special short-notice meeting with several other EU nations to deal with a migration crisis affecting the region, German mass-circulation daily Bild reported on Sunday. The possible meeting comes as Merkel struggles to avert a crisis within her coalition government on migration policy. She is engaged in a standoff with her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, over his plans to introduce stricter asylum laws, which would include turning people away at Germany's borders. The meeting could take place as early as next weekend, the newspaper reported, ahead of the regular EU summit scheduled for June 28 and 29 in Brussels.

The migrant situation has threatened to worsen in recent weeks, especially after Italy's new government refused to let a ship carrying hundreds of migrants dock at its ports. Italy has been a major entry point for migrants, especially from Africa. "So far nothing has been decided — we are in the planning phase," an Italian government source told Bild. "It is also unclear when the special summit could take place." Read more: Seehofer: The man who could bring down Angela Merkel? It's not yet clear whether Spain — which has seen a sharp rise in migrant arrivals in the past two years — and the Balkan countries would attend the special summit, Bild said. Coalition crisis looms Seehofer, of Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) party, wants to introduce new migration rules that would allow Germany to send people away at the border if they had already been refused asylum, or had applied for asylum, elsewhere in the EU. Merkel, who heads the CSU's conservative sister party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has argued against unilateral action, saying migrant policy can only be effectively agreed and implemented at the European level.

Seehofer has threatened to defy Merkel and go ahead with the plans as early as Monday. In a separate Bild report, the CSU veteran denied he was trying to split the conservative bloc. "Nobody in the CSU is interested in toppling the chancellor, dissolving the CDU/CSU partnership or blowing up the coalition [between the CDU/CSU and the Social Democrats]," Seehofer said. "We want to finally find a sustainable solution to the rejection of immigrants from our borders."
