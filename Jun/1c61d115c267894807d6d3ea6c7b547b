FIFA, football's governing body, announced on Monday that it has opened an investigation into homophobic chants from Mexico fans during their side's match against Germany. Mexico topped Germany 1-0 in Moscow's on Sunday in a match with plenty of Mexican support. An official anti-discrimination observer reported hearing shouts of "Puto" in the Luzhniki Stadium — a homophobic insult in Mexican Spanish aimed at opposition, usually at a goalkeeper when he takes goal kicks. The Mexican football federation, Femexfut or FMF, has urged traveling fans to stop using the chant, saying: "Think about the fact that you are a representative of the best fans in the world." If caught behaving badly, fans could face having their "Fan ID" confiscated — an official supporter document required to access matches and used instead of a Russian visa during the tournament. "Prevent Russia from taking away your Fan ID or arresting you," FMF addded on Twitter. FIFA already warned Mexico about the issue during last year's Confederations Cup, which also took place in Russia. Mexico's next game is against South Korea on Saturday. mf/dv (dpa,SID)
