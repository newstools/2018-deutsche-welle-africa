As the city of Munich announced on Wednesday, the price for the one liter Bavarian beer mug will be between 10.70 euros and 11.50 euros. This is on average 3.57 percent more than in the previous year. The main reason for the comparatively strong increase is the higher turnover rent, which the beer tent owner have to pay to the city. The tax, which was only introduced last year, even increased by 53 percent compared to the previous year, said host spokesman Peter Inselkammer. is/ks (dpa)
