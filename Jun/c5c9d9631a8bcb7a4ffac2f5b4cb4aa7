Alexander Zverev, the second seed, needed five sets and almost four hours to overcome Damir Dzumhur 6-2, 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (7/3), 7-5 on Friday. The victory means that the 21-year-old Hamburg native will be going to the fourth round at Roland Garros for the first time in his career. The young German got off to a good start in the match, winning the first set in just 24 minutes, and broke serve to take the lead in the second set as well. Not long afterwards, though, Dzumhur got the upper hand, taking the next two sets. ZverevÂ was his own worst enemy in what at times was a nightmare outing, as he hit 73 unforced errors, dropped serve seven times, and served up seven double faults. He also had to save a match point in the 11th game of the decider before breaking to punch his ticket for the final 16. "It was amazing, a very high-level match," Zverev said in the interview on Court Philippe Chatrier. "The crowd was unbelievable." Zverev, who many see as the main obstacle to Rafael Nadal claiming an 11th men's French Open title, was also pushed to five sets in his previous match against the 60th-ranked Serbian, Dusan Lajovic. This is just the second time that Zverev has reached the final 16 at a Grand Slam, after Wimbledon last year. Zverev's next opponent will be either 15th seed Lucas Poille of France or Russia's Karen Khachanov.
