A refugee, who is reportedly from Afghanistan, is on trial for the murder of Mia, a 15-year-old teenager from Kandel with whom he had been in a short relationship. The murder trial, which is being held in the southwestern city of Landau, is not open to the public as the suspect is being tried as a minor. His age has been difficult to ascertain, but authorities believe he was under 18 years of age when he allegedly committed the crime. He is believed to have acted out of jealousy, as the victim broke off the relationship and reported him to police for harassment prior to the murder last December. He reportedly approached Mia in a pharmacy and stabbed her seven times. The 'Kandel is everywhere' group has held regular protests against migrant policies since December The trial comes just weeks after the murder of 14-year-old Susanna, allegedly committed by an Iraqi refugee in the western city of Wiesbaden. Regular protests The German teen's death sparked regular anti-immigrant demonstrations in Kandel, most recently over the weekend, organized by a group called "Kandel is everywhere." The focus has now moved away from the girl's murder and aimed more broadly at what the demonstrators say is German Chancellor Angela Merkel's failed asylum policies. There have also been regular counterdemonstrations, organized by the group "We are Kandel." The trial is expected to last roughly two weeks. ng/kms (dpa, AFP) Send  Facebook   Twitter   google+   Whatsapp   Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/2uvX8
