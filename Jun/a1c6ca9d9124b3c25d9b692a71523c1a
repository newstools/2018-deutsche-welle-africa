Across the continent indigenous livestock species like the Ankole cattle are vanishing, with consequences for food security and ecological sustainability. On this edition of eco@africa we kick off by following the fight to protect indigenous cattle in Uganda. We then jump to Diepsloot township near Johannesburg, where sanitation and waste disposal is a challenge. We meet the kids taking an active role in making their community a healthier place to live. The images of plastic in our oceans can be heartbreaking to see. The initiative Ozeankind is setting its sights on ambitious targets to clean up our seas. The question is: can one project convince 1 million people to reduce their plastic waste? Next off we head to Nigeria, where a new program is aiming to empower the next generation of farmers. Thousands of young people have already signed up. With the impact of climate change a day to day reality, having the skills to farm sustainably in the future will be crucial. Could an aquatic fern help to make ships more eco-friendly? We see how kariba weed is providing inspiration for a new technology that could help reduce the impact of these ships in our oceans. Finally, we dig into the changes happening in Burkino Faso’s agriculture sector. In a country where 86 percent of the population live from farming, water is a precious resource. We explore the impact a new drip irrigation technology is having across the country. Check out the show and let us know what you think at ecoafrica@dw.com!
