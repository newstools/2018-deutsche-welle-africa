"Alexa, open DW World Cup." Five simple words that will give you access to DW's coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia from the comfort of your own home! Throughout the 2018 FIFA World Cup, DW will provide you with user-driven content covering the summer spectacle. Use nothing but the sound of your voice to get daily updates on the German national team's progress as well as answers to some of your burning questions. If you have one of Amazon's Alexa-controlled devices, download the DW World Cup skill. Once you've added the skill to your Alexa account and opened it, you will have two options at your disposal. Option 1: The latest news on the German national team Ask for "the latest news on the German national team" for a daily update from the Germany  camp as they look to defend their World Cup crown. DW's journalists will be providing on-the-ground reports from Russia, covering press conferences, fan culture and – hopefully – post-match celebrations. What did Joachim Löw have to say about the title holders? Will Marco Reus be in the starting lineup against Mexico? Answers and more are just a voice command away. Option 2: The question of the day Ask for "the question of the day” for a user-driven segment focused on answering the burning questions surrounding world football's most prestigious tournament. The biggest question though, is: What questions do you want answered by our trusty panel of journalists? You may want to know our thoughts on Lionel Messi's legacy if he doesn't get his hands on the trophy or simply how upset we were when Niklas Bendtner's World Cup dream came to an end. Either way you are invited to get in touch. To send in a question of your own, find us on Twitter or Facebook. We'll be answering one question a day throughout the competition and we want to hear from you!
