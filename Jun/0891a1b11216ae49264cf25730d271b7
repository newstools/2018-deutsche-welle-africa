Cuban lawmakers have approved a commission that will be tasked with updating the country's Soviet-era constitution.  President Miguel Diaz-Canel convened a special session of parliament on Saturday that saw legislators approve the commission to be led by former President Raul Castro and some 30 others, including Diaz-Canel. The current constitution was written in 1976 at the height of the Cold War. "This gives rise to a process of particular importance for the country and we must all be aware of the duty and the civic responsibility that this demands," Diaz-Canel said to nearly 600 delegates at the National Assembly.

During his time as president, Castro allowed some careful market opening and restored some US ties, but his government was also accused of repressing opposition. law/cmk (AP, dpa, Reuters) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
