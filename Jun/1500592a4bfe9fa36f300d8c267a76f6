The photo editing app "Handy Photo" features a rather unusual interface: To display the image in progress as large as possible, the developers have decided to hide all menus in the screen’s corners. When activated, options appear in a kind of wheel. This solution takes some time getting used to, but after a while you can handle it fine. The overall package convinces with high-quality tone and color tools and a variety of filters. Selective adjustments are possible as well.  Top 3 Pros: - Unusual design - "Retouch" tool for removing unwanted image elements - Selective adjustment options  Top 3 Cons:  - User interface takes time getting used to - App not available as a free version - “Cut out” functions not completely sound   Price: € 2.99 for iOS and Android Manufacturer: ADVA Soft
