Two people were killed and four injured in a shooting in the southern Swedish city of Malmo on Monday evening. The 18-year-old and 29-year-old died of their injuries shortly after they arrived at a local hospital, according to local media. A police spokesman told the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper that the shooter could have fired from within a car on the group, which was standing outside an internet cafe in Malmo's downtown Drottninggatan area. One witness told the Aftonbladet newspaper that he heard 15-20 shots near the internet cafe. Police have urged the public to remain calm and established a perimeter in Drottninggatan. They said they had no information on who the shooter or shooters might be and had no reason to think the incident was terrorism-related. "It is probably a shooting between criminals," police spokesman Fredrik Bratt said. The Sydsvenskan newspaper reported that victims were known to police. Feuds between rival gangs fighting over territory have taken place in major Swedish cities in recent years. amp, es/aw (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)
