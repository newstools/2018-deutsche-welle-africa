The Center for Economic Research (ZEW) released its sentiment indicator for June on Tuesday, showing investor morale fell to minus 16.1 points from minus 8.2 in May. This was a steeper drop than the consensus forecast reading of minus 14.0, and the lowest since 2012. A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the German economy's current conditions edged down to 80.6 from 87.4 last month. "The latest escalation in the trade dispute with the United States and fears about policies by the new Italian government that could destabilize the financial system are leaving their mark on the outlook for Germany," ZEW president Achim Wambach said in a statement.
