Seehofer dismissed the head of Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, Jutta Cordt, it was revealed on Friday, as divisions over immigration deepened at the top of Germany's ruling coalition. Cordt had been under heavy criticism after aninternal review by BAMF found that the agency's Bremen branch had regularly and knowingly ignored legal and internal regulations. An Interior Ministry spokesman told the DPA news agency that Seehofer had informed Cordt of his decision to dismiss her on Wednesday. The allegations over Bremen date back to the 2013-16 period. Cordt only took over the agency in 2017. Opposition lawmaker Linda Teuteberg of the pro-business Free Democrats said Cordt had been a "sacrificial lamb." However, Andrea Lindhaus, a CSU ally of Seehofer, said Cordt had "done a good job, but replacing her is the only way to re-establish trust for a new start."
