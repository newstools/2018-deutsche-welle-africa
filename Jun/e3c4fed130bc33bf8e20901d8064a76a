American Brooks Koepka has successfully defended his US Open golf title, narrowly beating Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who matched the lowest score in the tournament's history, a seven-under-par 63. Koepka shot a closing 68 to finish at one-over 281. "I'm at a loss for words right now," Koepka said Sunday at  Shinnecock Hills in New York state. "We grinded our tail off this week to come back from seven-over and do what we did. It was pretty special." The world No. 9 is the first player since Curtis Strange in 1988-89 to win back-to-back US Open titles. Dustin Johnson, who started the final round in a four-way tie for the lead with Koepka, Daniel Berger and Tony Finau, shot 70 for third place on three-over. Series of birdies But it was Fleetwood who gave a major scare to the defending champion. Playing more than two hours ahead of the overnight leaders, Fleetwood reeled off four consecutive birdies from the 12th hole. But Fleetwood's dream run soon ended and he failed to hit birdies in the final three holes, including an eight-footer at the last. The Englishman tied a US Open record with a final-round 63 but that proved insufficient in the end. "I honestly never really thought I was out of it," said the world No. 12, who started the day six strokes off the lead. "I just needed a good start. Looking at the pins you knew they were going to be more accessible. Four-under after seven and it was game on." ap/cmk (AP, Reuters, dpa, AFP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
