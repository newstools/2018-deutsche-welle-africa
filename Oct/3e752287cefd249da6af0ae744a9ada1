This week on eco@africa we bring you a special focus on the topic of plastic and check out many wonderful projects tackling the issue. First up, we head to Ghana where only 2 percent of the 22,000 tons of plastic it produces annually is recycled. One company has found a solution by turning used plastic into paving stones. Next up we meet the man who took on plastic bags — and won. James Wakibia is one of the most prominent environment activists in the country and the man behind the country's plastic bag ban. Do you get frustrated with the billions of drinking straws that end up in rubbish dumps every year? One German company is trying to change that, by creating a straw that you can actually eat! It has been estimated that on average there are four hundred pieces of microplastic in every cubic meter of sea water. We explore what needs to be done to tackle this critical issue. Next up we check out a Dutch company that is using the 1.5 million kilos of chewing gum that ends up on the streets to make 'Gumshoe' sneakers. And finally, we head to Ghana to find out what is going on with the vast landfill site in the middle of the capital Accra. We asked the country's environment minister about the site and waste management — the biggest challenge facing his ministry. Check out the show and let us know what you think at ecoafrica@dw.com!
