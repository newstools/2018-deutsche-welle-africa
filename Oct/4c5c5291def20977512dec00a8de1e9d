This week's show brings you many stories of innovation and environmental protection from across Africa and beyond! First up we head to Morocco, where an new digital platform aims to make organic produce more accessible and affordable to consumers. Goods are delivered directly to homes by electric powered vehicles. Have you heard of the hundreds of ghost nets haunting our oceans? These discarded fishing nets can pose a great danger to marine life. That's exactly why one German organsiation is collecting these nets and turning them into bracelets and bags. Next we are in the Central African Republic, where we meet activists trying to protect wildlife from the impact of poaching and conflict. Did you know over one hundred species die everyday? Our info film this week explores and explains the impact this has on our planet. Imagine if you could translate clicks on internet adverts into a positive impact on the environment? One search engine company based in Germany is doing just that, with a focus on reforestation projects across Africa. And finally we head to Nigeria to follow efforts to protect the country's last remaining lions. Check out the show and let us know what you think at ecoafrica@dw.com.
