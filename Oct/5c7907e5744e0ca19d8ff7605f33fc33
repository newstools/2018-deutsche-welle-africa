Latvia's pro-Russian Harmony party has won most votes in the country's general election, initial results showed on Sunday. Left-leaning Harmony, which had some 20 percent of votes after 90 percent had been counted, is the country's largest party but to date has been unable to form a government. The parties in the current ruling coalition — the Union of Greens and Farmers of Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis, the National Alliance and Unity — lost their collective majority, according to the results. That means they would have to find at least one other coalition member to form a majority government. Latvian Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis After the previous election in 2014, the Harmony party was already the country's largest with 24 parliamentary seats, but other Latvian parties refused to join it in a coalition over suspicions of its links with Moscow, despite its pro-EU stance. It enjoys broad support from the Russian minority, which accounts for about 25 percent of Latvia's nearly 2 million people, after nearly 50 years of Soviet occupation that ended in 1991. Gains for newcomers Populist newcomers KPV LV and another recently formed group, the anti-corruption New Conservative Party, were both on around 14 percent to become the second and third-biggest parties. The liberal For Development/For! party, which was also founded only recently, won around 12 percent. The Union of Greens and Farmers received just 10 percent of votes.  Turnout was 54.6 percent, the lowest since the country became independent from the Soviet Union. Some 1.5 million Latvians were eligible to vote. Full results are expected on Sunday. tj, jm/es (AP, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
