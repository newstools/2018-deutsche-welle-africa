French prosecutors have charged a 15-year-old with aggravated assault, after a video of the teenager pointing a fake gun at his teacher made the rounds on social media. The incident took place on Thursday in the Paris suburb of Creteil and was later uploaded online by one of the teenager's classmates. The teacher filed a complaint with police the following day, after which the boy presented himself to police accompanied by his father. In the video, the teenager can be seen standing over the seated teacher brandishing what turned out to be an air gun. "You've marked me absent. Mark me as present," he shouts as another student tries to plead his case with the teacher. French newspaper Le Parisien reported that the boy, who was late for class, was angry after the teacher had already marked him as absent.  The teacher in the clip appears more weary than panicked and continues to work on her laptop while exchanging a few inaudible remarks.
