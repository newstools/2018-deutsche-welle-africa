Five days before the WTA championships are set to begin in Singapore, Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber has split from coach Wim Fissette, her management said on Tuesday. "Despite the success of the cooperation since the start of the season, this step is needed because of differences of opinion as the future direction," a statement read. The Belgian tennis coach joined forces with Kerber in November 2017 and helped the former world number one return to prominence. He is also the former coach of Kim Clijsters, Victoria Azarenka and current world number one Simona Halep. Kerber, 30, is in the midst of a bounce back year after falling outside the top 30 in 2017. The Bremen native reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in January and lifted the Wimbledon trophy in July after beating Serena Williams. She is currently third in the world rankings ahead of the season-ending WTA Finals, which begin on Sunday in Singapore.
