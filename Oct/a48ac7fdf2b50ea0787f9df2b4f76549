A criminal investigation against Russia internationals Alexander Kokorin and Pavel Mamayev has been opened, with the pair accused of carrying out violent attacks in central Moscow. The attacks, allegedly perpetrated by the Zenit St Petersburg forward Kokorin and Krasnodar midfielder Mamayev on Monday according to Russian police, were captured on CCTV — prompting widespread outrage and reaction from the Kremlin. Footage, which has been circulated widely by the Russian media, shows a man being kicked and punched in the street by a group of people said to include the two footballers and another incident in which two civil servants appeared to be assaulted in a cafe. Mamayev and Kokorin have declined to comment on the issue so far. The two players were summoned by police for questioning on Wednesday and told that if they did not appear then nationwide search warrants would be issued. Police said both players had turned up and had been detained over charges of hooliganism, which carries a maximum jail sentence of seven years. Police did not comment on the length of the detention period. Kokorin has 48 caps for Russia but missed this year's World Cup with a knee injury. Mamayev has represented the national team 15 times. The two men also face possible sanctions from their clubs, and Krasnodar said it was exploring ways to terminate Mamayev's contract. mds/ (AFP, AP)
