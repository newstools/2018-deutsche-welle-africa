A Cesna plane crashed through a barrier and hit two adults and child during a botched landing on Sunday, killing all three, German police said. The pilot of the sports aircraft was apparently attempting to land on the mountain of Wasserkuppe in the central German state of Hesse. First responders have been deployed to the site. Mass-circulation daily Bild reported another eight people were injured. According to the police, the pilot failed to align the plane with the runway for landing and tried to lift off once again, but the aircraft lost power and crashed into a group of passers-by just outside the airfield. The mountain is a popular site for paragliders and light aircraft enthusiasts, and boasts a small airfield. Trekkers and other visitors also frequent the mountain. More to come... dj/rcÂ (AFP, DPA)
