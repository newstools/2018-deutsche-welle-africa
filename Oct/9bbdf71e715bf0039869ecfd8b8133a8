Some of Belgium's top football clubs were targeted in police raids on Wednesday morning as part of investigations into money laundering and possible match-fixing, according to Belgian broadcasters VRT and RTBF. The offices of Belgium's most successful club, Anderlecht, and the current champions Club Bruges were among those searched by prosecutors, with Bruges coach Ivan Leko questioned. Standard Liege and Racing Genk were also targeted, as were two referees, according to Belgian outlet Het Laatse Niews. According to Belgian daily De Standard, the main targets of the probe are Belgian-Iranian football agent Mogi Bayat (pictured, top) and another agent - plus clubs with whom they have done business. Federal prosecutors told news agency AFP that Bayat, 44, the former manager of Sporting Charleroi, had been arrested in his home "in connection with an investigation into football". A total of 57 police raids took place across Europe, with 44 happening in Belgium and the remainder in France, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Montenegro, Serbia and Macedonia. Along with searches at "various football clubs," the prosecutor's office said club committee members, agents, referees, a former lawyer, an accountancy bureau, coaches, journalists and possible accomplices were under investigation.  mf/mp (Reuters, AFP)
