Polls opened in the country of Georgia on Sunday morning to elect the country's next president, widely being considered a referendum on the unpopular ruling party. The hotly contested race has pitted former foreign minister Salome Zurabishvili, supported by the ruling Georgian Dream party, against opposition leader Grigol Vashadze, also an ex-foreign minister. Zurabishvili and Vashadze are among 25 candidates vying to win the largely ceremonial role. Incumbent Giorgi Margvelashvili is not running. The two leading candidates have an almost equal chance of being elected, but neither is expected to get the necessary 50 percent plus one vote to win in the first round, according to opinion polls published ahead of the vote. Runoff expected in December A runoff between the top two candidates is to be held by December 1. At 12 p.m. local time (0800 UTC), turnout stood at just 16 percent, the central election commission said. Both candidates have run similar campaigns, promising to bring the country closer to NATO and the European Union. The ballot is Georgia's last direct leadership poll following controversial constitutional reforms last year that will see the country transition to a parliamentary form of governance. Some 3.5 million people are registered to vote in the election, which is being monitored by local and international groups. mm,es/amp (AFP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
