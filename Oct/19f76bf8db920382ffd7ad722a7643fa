This week on eco@africa we travel from South Africa to Cameroon to bring you a host of innovative ideas helping to make our planet a greener place. Frist, we have a look at how some farmers are rehabilitating their land in South Africa's Eastern Cape by growing plants that produce essential oils instead of raising animals. The herbs are an alternative source of income and require little water and help prevent desertification. Then we see how Kenyan herders are using apps to find fresh water and rich pasture land while avoiding dangerous predators. After that we visit a creative entrepreneur in Cameroon who is turning old oil drums into furniture, before heading over to Mauritania to see how rising ocean levels and dams are destroying the delicate balance of the country's coast. Then we go to Germany to see the next generation of efficient buildings. Back in Africa we visit a school that is using waste maize spindles to produce briquettes, which can be used instead of firewood — reducing deforestation and improving energy efficiency. Check out the show and let us know what you think at ecoafrica@dw.com!
