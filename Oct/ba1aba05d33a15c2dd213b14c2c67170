Erdener flagged up Senegal's "booming economy" and better conditions than the other bidders from Botswana, Nigeria and Tunisia as a major reason for its success.

"In Africa, when a family organizes a party all the neighbors chip in and they help to organize the event," said Lydia Nsekera of Burundi, who also sits on FIFA's ruling council. mp/mf (AP/DPA)
