Augsburg was one of the two home sides that advanced to the third round after a comeback 3-2 victory over Mainz. Mainz took a 2-1 lead into the break after goals from Philipp Mwene and Robin Quaison — an own goal from Mainz's Stefan Bell was sandwiched in between. But Michael Gregoritsch scored an equalizer in the 86th minute to force extra time, and Caiuby scored the winner in the 105th minute. Wolfsburg picked up their second win in four days by beating Hannover 2-0 in HDI Arena. Admir Mehmedi gave the visitors the lead in the first half when he finished a pass from Daniel Ginczek. Wout Weghorst added a goal in stoppage time, his fourth goal in his last five games in all competitions. All the other Bundesliga sides in action were victorious on Tuesday. Hertha Berlin defeated Darmstadt 2-0 thanks to second half goals from Vedad Ibisevic and Max Mittelstädt. Even Fortuna Düsseldorf, who have lost their last five Bundesliga games, advanced to the third round after trouncing fourth-tier side Ulm 5-1 — although Ulm's Adrian Morina scored 14 seconds into the game. The remaining eight fixtures will be played on Wednesday, with Borussia Dortmund among those in action.
