What is it about? The "Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the elimination of their Intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles," also known as "the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty," or "INF Treaty" sought to destroy both countries' ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (300 to 3,400 miles), their launchers and associated support structures and support equipment. It led to the destruction of almost 2,700 missiles and their launchers by the June 1, 1991 deadline stipulated in the treaty. The INF treaty was the first US-Soviet agreement aimed at reducing the superpowers' nuclear arsenal and allow on-site inspections to verify the destruction of the missiles. It remained in force after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. US soldiers prepare to remove Pershing-II missiles from a base in the German town of Mutlangen How did the treaty come about? Official talks began in late 1981 between then-US President Ronald Reagan and then-Soviet Leader Leonid Brezhnev. The talks and subsequent treaty were the result of Western concern over the Soviet Union's efforts to modernize its missile arsenal. In the mid 1970s, the Soviets had reached what's known as "strategic parity" with the US with its new SS-20 missiles, which were capable of reaching Western Europe, North Africa and the Middle East among others. The INF treaty was signed on December 8, 1987 by Reagan and then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Washington DC. It came into force on June 1, 1988.
