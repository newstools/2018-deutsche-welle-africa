It’s October and once again the two light festivals "Berlin Illuminated" and the "Festival of Lights" are trying to outshine each other in the German capital. Facades and monuments throughout the city are being colorfully illuminated, including landmarks such as the Berlin Dome and the concert hall in the Gendarmenmarkt. More light: concert hall in the Gendarmenmarkt A laser show is being projected onto the Siegessäule for 17 days, and a similar show can be seen at the Oberbaum Bridge between Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg. The two light festivals “Berlin Lights” and "Festival of Lights" focus on the artistic presentation of illuminations on the city’s landmarks, such as Berlin Cathedral, seen here. An illuminated panorama celebrates the twentieth anniversary of the reconstruction of Potsdamer Platz. One of five different tours of the light shows starts at Bode Museum. It leads across Museum Island, past Berlin Cathedral to the Television Tower on Alexanderplatz. For the first time, the pavement in front of the Concert House on Gendarmenmarkt is being used as a playground for light artists, along with its façade. Visitors can face off using a video mapping game, inspired by the mobile game “Snake,” on the huge façade of the Humboldt Forum. Light artists are also giving the legendary Operncafé on Berlin’s Unter den Linden boulevard a new temporary decoration. Few things dominate the skyline of Berlin more than construction cranes. But rarely are they as colorful as they appear on these nights in October. For those who fancy something slightly different, the Breitscheidplatz is hosting a light art market with stalls and food stands. The square will be decorated with 200 glowing balloons, giant hearts and lit up columns. The light festivals can be seen until 14 October, daily from 7pm to midnight.
