An American astronaut and Russian cosmonaut aborted their flight to the International Space Station on Thursday after a booster failure on the Soyuz spacecraft. "The Soyuz capsule is returning to Earth via a ballistic descent, which is a sharper angle of landing compared to normal," said NASA mission control in Houston. Rookie astronaut Nick Hague and veteran cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin "have been in contact with rescue forces," according to NASA. "Thank God, the crew is alive," said Russian President Vladimir Putin spokesman Dmitri Peskov. Read more: Will we evolve to adapt to life in space?
