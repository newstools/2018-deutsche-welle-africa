It’s October and once again the two light festivals "Berlin Illuminated" and the "Festival of Lights" are trying to outshine each other in the German capital. Facades and monuments throughout the city are being colorfully illuminated, including landmarks such as the Berlin Dome and the concert hall in the Gendarmenmarkt. More light: concert hall in the Gendarmenmarkt A laser show is being projected onto the Siegessäule for 17 days, and a similar show can be seen at the Oberbaum Bridge between Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg. For those who fancy something slightly different, the Breitscheidplatz is hosting a light art market with stalls and food stands. The square will be decorated with 200 glowing balloons, giant hearts and lit up columns. The light festivals can be seen until 14 October, daily from 7pm to midnight.
