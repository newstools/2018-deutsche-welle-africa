Masterpieces of Florentine Renaissance painting can be admired as of Thursday at the exhibition "Florence and its Painters: From Giotto to Leonardo da Vinci" held at the Alte Pinakothek museum in Munich until January 27, 2019. Florence, the capital city of Italy's Tuscany region, went through an important cultural shift during the 15th century, thanks to the patronage of powerful families such as the Medici, said the exhibition's curator Andreas Schumacher at the press presentation of the show. Florence set the standards at the time, Schumacher added. Hundreds of artists, including renowned ones such as Domenico Ghirlandaio, Andrea del Verrocchio or Leonardo da Vinci, had their workshops there and their work was high in demand.

The invaluable work was cautiously transported from the Uffizi Gallery in Florence to Munich. Altar pieces are also on show, including several panels painted by Fra Angelico in 1438/1440 for the high altar of the church of San Marco in Florence. The scenes from the lives of the Saints Cosmas and Damian as well as the Entombment of the Christ are usually scattered across several museums.
