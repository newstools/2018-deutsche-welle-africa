At least seven people have died in Italy after strong winds and heavy rain hit much of the country and caused severe flooding in Venice. Two people were killed in Terracina 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of Rome after a tornado swept through the town and caused a tree to fall on their car, according to state broadcaster RAI. Three people were also killed by falling trees near Rome and another died in Naples after strong winds hit the area. In Savona, an elderly woman died after a tornado lashed the northwestern province. Falling trees have led to multiple deaths across the country Venice under water In Venice, flooding caused the water level to hit 156 centimeters (61 inches), a 10-year high, and an evacuation of the city's famous St Mark's Square. The water level has only reached above 150 centimeters five times since records began, most famously in 1966, when it hit 194 centimeters and devastated the historic city center. The extreme weather, which began on Sunday, has caused widespread disruption throughout the country. Authorities temporarily suspended rail and car traffic near the Brenner Pass, the Alpine route linking Italy to Austria, after a landslide made some parts of the motorway impassable. Some 160,000 households were left without electricity in Belluno and Treviso provinces, according to the regional newspaper Il Gazzettino. amp/aw (dpa, AFP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
