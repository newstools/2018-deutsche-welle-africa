On Saturday, a 36-year-old man strolled through Dusseldorf's central train station with a 1.8-meter-long (5.9-foot-long) boa constrictor around his neck. The sight of the man with a large snake on his shoulders caused excitement among people at the station. Police later confiscated the reptile with the help of a fire department animal expert. Police said the man could not prove he was the owner of the snake. Also, carrying a snake in public is not considered appropriate. Authorities will hand the boa constrictor over to a zoo on Sunday. Until then, it will stay with the fire department. The boa constrictor, also known as the red-tailed boa or the common boa, is a large, nonvenomous snake that is usually kept and bred in captivity. It is often found in tropical North, Central and South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean. shs/jlw (AFP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
