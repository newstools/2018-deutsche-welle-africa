Northern Irish author Anna Burns on Tuesday became the first writer from her country to win Britain's esteemed Man Booker Prize for her novel "Milkman." The novel, which judges honored as "utterly distinctive," explores the thirty years of Catholic-Protestant violence in Northern Ireland known as "The Troubles." The 56-year-old's novel was one of six in the running for the 50,000-pound (€57,000, $66,000) prize. Other shortlisted works included "The Overstory" by American author Richard Powers and "Washington Black" by Canadian writer Esi Edugyan. Burns said she was "stunned" after receiving the award from Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall at a ceremony in London. The Man Booker Prize is widely considered to be Britain's most prestigious literary award. amp/dj (AP, AFP) At 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of news and features.
