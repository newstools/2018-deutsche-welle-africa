The concert comes from the Eight Bridges festival in Cologne, where the focus is on music from the 20th and 21st centuries, including newly commissioned works. The composer York Höller explained the circumstances of his creative effort: "In the middle of the composition I got the information that Pierre Boulez had died. We had had a very good relationship. He conducted my music rather often and commissioned new music from me. So I had the desire to react in a certain way to his death. At the same time I remembered a poem by the French symbolist Paul Verlaine. The melancholy in the poem influenced the writing of my music. In it, he used a metaphor: Le violon de l'automne (The Violin of Autumn)." Setting his concerto for the deeper-pitched viola, Höller dedicated it to German violist Tabea Zimmermann, who performs it in our program and explained to us what she values in the piece: "I love the different colors and ideas, the three very distinctly different movements with very clear characters in the different sections. There is a lot of virtuosity, of singing. There are fragile moments too. I think what he did particularly well is to achieve a good, transparent sound with the orchestra because that is the main difficulty for a viola concerto. If you have a big orchestration with percussion and winds and everybody plays at the same time, then the violist might as well stay home. But he did it in such a clever way that there's a lot of correspondence with the orchestra. So the orchestra joins in and supports me. But it remains a very transparent score, and I like that very much."
