Sara Netanyahu appeared in a Jerusalem court on Sunday on the first day of a trial over her alleged overspending of state money on catered meals at the prime minister's official residence, despite a full-time chef having been employed to cook. If convicted, Netanyahu, 59, could face up to five years of prison. She has been charged with fraudulently obtaining more than $100,000 (â‚¬86,7000) from the state for ordering hundreds of meals from restaurants, bypassing rules that forbid using such monies if a cook is employed at home. The meals allegedly came from a number of well-known restaurants in Jerusalem, including an Italian restaurant, a Middle Eastern grill joint and a sushi restaurant. A statement from her lawyers on Sunday said the food had been ordered against her will. The court hearing was adjourned after a short time until November 13. The trial is expected to last for months.

In 2016, a labor court in Jerusalem found her guilty of abusing an employee at the official residence and ordered her to pay $42,000 in damages, while in 2018, the Netanyahus won a libel suit against an Israeli reporter, Igal Sarna, who claimed Sara had once thrown her husband Benjamin out of a car onto the side of the road during an argument.
