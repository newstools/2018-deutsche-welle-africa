Cristiano Ronaldo has used social media again to vehemently deny  raping Kathryn Mayorga in 2009. These tweets come after Ronaldo said the following on an Instagram live video on September 30:  "Fake news. They want to promote by my name. It's normal," he said. "They want to be famous to say my name. But if it's part of the job, I'm a happy man and it's all good." The post was subsequently deleted. German magazine Der Spiegel initially published Mayorga's accusations, stating the lawyer's case is based on a document containing Ronaldo's account of what happened on June 12, 2009. In it, Spiegel reported that the 33-year-old "said 'no' and 'stop' several times." Lawyers for the Juventus forward responded by saying they would sue Der Spiegel, while Las Vegas police confirmed they had re-opened a case filed on that date but did not identify the victim or the alleged perpetrator. Mayorga's lawyers are to hold a news conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday to discuss the case. jh/msh (AFP)
