European football's governing body (UEFA) announced on Thursday that it had barred Rubin Kazan from taking part in the Champions League or the Europa League if it qualifies for either in the next two seasons. Without providing further details, the statement posted on UEFA's website to announce the decision said the Russian club had breached the "Settlement Agreement," and that Rubin could appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Rubin had agreed to a settlement with UEFA in the first round of Financial Fair Play (FFP) judgments handed down in 2014, which also included deals with Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.  At the time, UEFA fined Rubin €3 million ($3.5 million) in competition prize money. A further €3 million euros was liable if it breached the settlement, as UEFA has ruled that it has now done. Rubin last played in the Europa League in 2015-16 and took part in the Champions League group stage in 2009 and 2010. The club is currently in fifth place in the Russian league, two points off second place, which secures direct qualification for the Champions League group stage. pfd/mds (AP, dpa, Reuters)
