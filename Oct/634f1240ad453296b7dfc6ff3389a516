Online retailer eBay filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against its competitor Amazon, accusing the Seattle-based giant of using eBay's own messaging system to steal sellers. eBay described Amazon's scheme as an "orchestrated, coordinated, worldwide campaign" to "illegally lure eBay sellers." While both eBay and Amazon's revenue is boosted by independent sellers, the group has become a greater part of Amazon's recent growth. In 2017, more than half the items sold on Amazon came from third-party sellers. In eBay's lawsuit, Amazon representatives are accused of creating eBay accounts and then messaging sellers to persuade them to take their goods to Amazon.com instead. eBay argues that the move violated its user agreement. The plaintiff claimed that Amazon's "abuse" was systematic and had the sole purpose of harming Ebay. Read more: Is the Amazon effect behind low inflation? Trying to avoid detection in messages?
