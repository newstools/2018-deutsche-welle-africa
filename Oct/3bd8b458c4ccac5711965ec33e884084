At the moment, many residents use mouth and nose masks in order to avoid inhaling emissions particles, but authorities in the Vietnamese capital are working toward a more lasting solution. They're planning to ban the polluting vehicles from the city's streets, and to replace them with electric scooters and buses. They are also planning to plant new trees. A film by Michael Wetzel
