Euromaxx is reinventing itself! For one week, it’s putting prominent European cultural figures in charge. They’ll choose the reports and present “their” program along with the Euromaxx presenters at locations of their choice. For these special “Euromaxx Edition” programs, our team went to Amsterdam, London, Berlin, Rome, and Maastricht, and got a behind-the-scenes look. We’d like to know which famous European you’d like to see on our show. Who do you think should be a guest editor of a “Euromaxx Edition” show? Let us know! As a thank you, we’ll give away autographed gifts from our guest editors. Write to tell us which one you’d like to have. You can choose from photography books by Sir David Chipperfield or designer Marcel Wanders, two Biagotti perfumes, a DVD by violinist and conductor André Rieu, two cookbooks by chef Tim Raue, or a photography book by celebrity photographer and director Rankin.  Here’s how to participate! The deadline is October 26, 2018, at 2:00 pm UTC. All decisions are final. Good luck!
