Project aim: To provide policymakers in relevant government offices with strategies to make China's transportation sector climate-friendly Implementing organization: German development agency GIZ Project funding: €3,500,000 ($4,037,080) from Germany's Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety Project duration: March 2015 - January 2019 Until the 1990s, cycling was the most important form of transport in Beijing, but increasing affluence and transportation policies geared toward cars went a long way to pushing the humble bicycle off the city's roads. In 2016, the first "free-floating" rental bikes appeared on the scene and since then, this more traditional and environmentally friendly mode of transport has made a comeback. Now efforts are underway to keep the two wheels turning. A film by Michael Bölinger
