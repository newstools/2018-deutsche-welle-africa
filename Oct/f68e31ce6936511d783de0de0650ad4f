A male teacher in the town of Salzgitter, near Braunschweig, was sentenced to 10 months' probation on Tuesday for suggesting a female student, 14, send him naked photos to get better grades. The man, 37, was also ordered to pay a €5,000 ($5,800) fine. The man was also accused of telling two other female students that he would exchange better grades for a kiss. According to the local Braunschweiger Zeitung, the man was a teacher at the Gottfried-Linke-Realschule, a high school in Salzgitter. The girl told authorities that she sent the man two photos of herself because she was nervous about having to tell her parents about a bad grade. The suit against the man was brought after the school became aware of his misconduct and notified the authorities. School officials made it clear that the man is no longer teaching and is currently in disciplinary arbitration. A wide-ranging survey from the German daily Die Zeit in March 2018 found that in Germany, every second female pupil who is a victim of sexual harassment or assault was abused by a teacher.
