Whether we’re talking about deciduous, coniferous, rain or dry forests, a healthy forest is maintained by a delicate balancing act of give and take. Many people live directly from and in forests, which provide food, shelter and even medicinal plants for healing. Still, when economic interests take over, this delicate symbiotic relationship can be thrown out of balance. Economic and environmental interests often clash in the forest because wood is a wildly popular and seemingly irreplaceable raw material for entire industrial sectors, including paper and pulp. But vast swathes of forest are also destroyed, not for their wood, but to make way for palm oil and soy plantations, cattle ranching and mining. What can children and young people do to help protect the forest? How can they help restore balance? Deutsche Welle’s learning pack “Protecting our forests: A vital ecosystem under threat” enables educators to tackle this topic with young people aged 12 to 16, as well as with youth and environment groups. The learning pack "Protecting our forests: A vital ecosystem under threat" includes: All materials may be used by educational institutions for non-commercial purposes free of charge. You can also send us an e-mail to request a printed version of the learning pack with a DVD.
