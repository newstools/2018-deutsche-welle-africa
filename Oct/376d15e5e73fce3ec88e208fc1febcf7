Far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro will face leftist Fernando Haddad in the second round of Brazil's presidential election, scheduled for October 28. Bolsonaro got roughly 46 percent of the first-round votes, while Fernando Haddad from the Workers' Party was in second place with just under 29 percent.

Leftist candidate Haddad was appointed by jailed ex-President Lula Bolsonaro, a former army captain, has campaigned on promises of cracking down on violence and corruption, but has also included praise for Brazil's former military dictatorship, derogatory comments about women and gay people, and wants to fight crime by loosening controls on already deadly police forces. His campaign was boosted after he was nearly stabbed to death at a rally one month ago, which kept him from campaigning. Bolsonaro's Social Liberal Party (PSL), insignificant until recently, is poised to become the second-largest force in Congress after legislative elections also held on Sunday.

Haddad is the leftist Workers Party stand-in for former President Luiz Inacio da Silva, who is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for corruption, and had his presidential candidacy barred earlier this year. His campaign focused on traditional leftist aims of fighting long-standing inequalities, scrapping a major liberal labor reform passed last year and investing more in education.
