Inger-Maria Mahlke has won the German Book Prize for 2018 for her novel Archipel, (Archipelago). The novel tells the story of three families on the Canary Island of Tenerife from different social classes in Franco-era Spain. Mahlke's mother is from the Canary Islands. "This is where colonial history and the history of European dictatorships in the 20th century coalesce," the jury said of Archipel. In her book, Mahlke travels backward in time from the present to 1919. "I had to take everything I know about storytelling, about building suspense, conveying information and forget it or turn it upside down," Mahlke said ahead of the prize ceremony.
