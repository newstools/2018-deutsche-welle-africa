Brazil's top electoral court said on Friday it would formally investigate allegations that election front-runner Jair Bolsonaro had backed a widespread misinformation campaign to undermine his leftist rival. The court's announcement comes after left-wing candidate Fernando Haddad and his allies accused Bolsonaro of illegally sanctioning several "defamatory" mass messaging attacks via WhatsApp. Bolsonaro, who is expected to win the Brazilian presidency by a landslide in the second round of voting on October 28, has denied the accusations, saying he is not responsible for what his supporters might do.

According to a report Thursday in local newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, several digital marketing firms have leveraged WhatsApp's encrypted services to circulate unregistered political propaganda, most of it attacking Haddad. The opposition claims the campaigns are being bankrolled by pro-Bolsonaro businessmen at the candidate's behest. Enough to sway voters? It remains unclear whether the accusations have had any bearing on opinion polls. The latest survey, taken before the initial report was published, showed Bolsonaro enjoying 59 percent of the vote, compared to Haddad on 41 percent. Since then, however, the allegations appear to have energized Haddad's campaign. His leftist Workers' Party claims it has witnesses saying Bolsonaro had asked business leaders for cash to pay for the bulk messaging. That, they allege, amounts to illegally soliciting undeclared campaign contributions.

However, it has come under increasing scrutiny in the country as the main medium for disseminating fake news. While platform like Facebook and Twitter are easier to police, WhatsApp users exchange information directly over an encrypted network. WhatsApp vows to fight on 'illegal' mas messages Reacting to the report, WhatsApp announced Friday that it was "immediate legal action to stop companies from sending bulk messages." The tech company said previously that it had banned hundreds of thousands of accounts inside Brazil found to have engaged in spam or automated "bot" behavior ahead of the election. Of those accounts belongs to Bolsonaro's son, although the ban has since been lifted. WhatsApp confirmed that it had Flavio Bolsonaro for "spam behavior" and reasons unconnected to the Folha report.
