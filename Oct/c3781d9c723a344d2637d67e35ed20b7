Turkish investigators on Monday began a search of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul for the first time since journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared. The team arrived in an unmarked police car and made no comments to reporters gathered outside the consulate as international concern grew over Khashoggi's fate. Khashoggi, who has been critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has not been seen since he visited the Saudi consulate two weeks to get documents he needed to get married. Turkish officials said they fear a Saudi hit team killed and dismembered Khashoggi, allegations the Saudi kingdom has dismissed the claims as "baseless," however it has not presented evidence of the journalist leaving the consulate. It is not clear what kind of search the officials will conduct and whether it will include a forensic examination, given that it has been almost two weeks since the reporter entered the building. Further, a team of cleaners were reported to have entered the consulate on Monday lunchtime — "causing a minor flurry of excitement," according to one reporter — hours before the search team showed up.

His comments followed a phone call with King Salman in which Trump said he strongly denied any knowledge of what happened to the journalist. "The king firmly denied any knowledge of it," Trump told reporters, echoing earlier comments he made on Twitter. "I mean, who knows? We're going to try getting to the bottom of it very soon, but his was a flat denial." Meanwhile, Trump sent the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to Riyadh to meet King Samlan.

"If they don’t buy it from us, they’re going to buy it from Russia or they’re going to buy it from China," he said. "Think of that, $110 billion. All they’re going to do is give it to other countries, and I think that would be very foolish."
