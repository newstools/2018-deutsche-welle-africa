A 7.0 magnitude earthquake in the largest city in the northwestern US state of Alaska rattled buildings in the city of Anchorage and caused lampposts and trees to sway. A tsunami warning was issued by one agency for the coastal areas of southern Alaska, including Cook Inlet and the southern Kenai Peninsula. Authorities have instructed people to seek high ground. The US Geological Survey also logged several aftershocks in the area, as is common after any larger quake. They added that the epicenter of the quake appeared to be located 7 miles (13 kilometers) north of Anchorage. It is unclear whether there were injuries. Anchorage residents posted pictures on social media of massively cracked roads and damaged buildings following the earthquake. Journalist Cassie Schirm with TV station KTVA posted a picture on Twitter showing the damage to the station's newsroom. More to follow... rs/msh (AP, dpa)
