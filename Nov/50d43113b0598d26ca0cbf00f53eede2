Houthi militants announced they would stop their "drone and missile strikes" against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and their allies in Yemen. The rebels said they were ready for a broader armistice if "the Saudi coalition wants peace" in a Sunday statement signed by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the rebels' Supreme Revolutionary Committee. The warring parties had previously agreed to meet for peace talks in Sweden. While the date has not been set, UN envoy Martin Griffiths said it would be "soon" and that he plans to travel to rebel-held Sanaa later this week to discuss arrangements. Al-Houthi also called on fellow rebels to stop launching attacks against the Saudi alliance to show goodwill and deprive the alliance of any justification for further attacks against Houthi forces.
