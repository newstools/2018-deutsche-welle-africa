A Roman Catholic priest from the eastern German diocese of Magdeburg has turned himself into police, telling them he had lost €120,000 ($137,000) on what appeared to be an online gambling scam. The 64-year-old man, who works in the parish of St. Elisabeth Ballenstedt, also confessed his misdemeanor to the head of the diocese, Bishop Gerhard Feige, who has dismissed him as leader of the parish council and made it clear that the money must be paid back. Feige said on Sunday that the priest had to "bear the legal and canonical consequences" of his actions. "No priest, no church employee, is allowed to steal monies meant for the parish and use them for any other purpose," Feige said.
