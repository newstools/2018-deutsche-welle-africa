The 2032 Olympics host is expected to be elected by the IOC in 2025. So far the Games have never been co-hosted but a joint Korean bid is expected to be welcomed by the IOC. Indonesia and India have also expressed an interest in hosting the Summer Games in 2032. "Plan to mark meaningful anniversaries" After meeting at the border between the two countries, Korean sports officials also agreed to send a combined team to the World Handball Championship in January. It comes as part of a promise to "actively participate" in international sports events hosted by each other and organize more friendly competitions between them. "The plan is to organize friendly competitions marking meaningful anniversaries between the South and North, for example the first anniversaries of the (April) inter-Korean summit and the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics," said South Korean Vice Sports Minister Roh Tae-kang. Athletes from North and South Korea marched under a unified peninsula flag at the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics earlier this year. jt/pfd (AP, dpa)
