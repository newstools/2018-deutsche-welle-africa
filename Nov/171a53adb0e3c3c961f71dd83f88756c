Polls opened on Wednesday in Fiji as the Pacific Island nation held its second general election since a military coup toppled the government in 2006. Half a million people are expected to cast their votes as two leaders of separate military coups vie for the premiership in the popular tourist destination. The incumbent, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, has remained in power since his bloodless takeover 12 years ago. He allowed a general election in 2014 and won reelection in a landslide victory.
