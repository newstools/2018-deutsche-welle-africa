The media said searches for missing people were continuing after the floods struck in several areas of the country, including the popular tourist destination of Petra. Some 3,500 tourists had to be evacuated from Petra on Friday, with water surging through parts of the famed ancient trading center. No casualties in the city were reported. Government spokeswoman Jumana Ghuneimat on Friday called on residents living in low-lying regions to evacuate their homes, according to the kingdom's official Petra news agency.
