But as traditional grazing land is given over to agriculture, the herders' way of life has come under threat, and a growing number of young people are left with little choice but to move to urban areas in search of jobs. An NGO is working with the Raika to establish a system that enables them to market wool and milk products derived from their animals. A film by Cornelia Borrmann
