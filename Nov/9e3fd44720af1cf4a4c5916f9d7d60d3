As the clock winds down on her final term as chancellor, Angela Merkel began by looking back on the EU's achievements and highlighting Europe's diversity, which was also its strength, she told the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday.

Only a stronger Europe, Merkel said, would be able to defend its values. "We need to take our fate into our own hands," Merkel told the assembly.

Addressing the challenges facing the eurozone, Merkel said it and the common currency could only function "if every individual member fulfills their responsibility for sustainable finances," a clear reference to the current showdown between Italy and the EU Commission over the former's refusal to back down from its big-spending budget, which the Commission rejected last month.
