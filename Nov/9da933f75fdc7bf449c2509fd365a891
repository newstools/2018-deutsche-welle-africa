"I look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved!" The sudden cancellation came just an hour after Trump told reporters he would likely sit down with Putin and it was "a very good time to have the meeting." The Kremlin said it had not been notified of the cancellation and first learned about it from the tweet. Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said the cancellation meant that Putin would have "a couple more hours" for "useful meetings" with other leaders. On Sunday, Russia fired on three Ukrainian naval ships off the coast of Crimea and seized the vessels and 24 Ukrainian seamen. Russia said Ukraine didn't have permission to pass through the Kerch Strait, which separates mainland Russia from annexed Crimea. Ukraine said its ships were in international waters. In response, Ukraine imposed martial law. cw/msh (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)
