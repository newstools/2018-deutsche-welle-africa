This week's show brings you stories from the world's oceans, Rwanda's forests and the fight to protect one very small animal in South Africa. First up we head to Madagascar, where droughts and population growth have made clean portable water scarce in the capital city Antananarivo. One organisation is tackling that by training local residents to manage their water infrastructure. Next up, we stay with the water theme but head to the ocean. For this week's Doing Your Bit, we meet two Australian surfers who have developed a garbage can that floats in the ocean, collecting rubbish while filtering the water for impurities. Then we head to Johannesburg, South Africa, where conservationists are working to protect the future of a frog. The Pickersgill's Reed frog measures only 30mm and has been an endangered species for eight years. Next we check out the growing popularity of a new eco-soap in Nigeria. Abiola Ogunrinde produces soap from natural local products such as shea butter and aloe vera. What does the future hold for transport in our cities? With rising air pollution and traffic a growing problem across the world, new innovations are emerging to improve how we move around our cities. And last but not least, we visit Rwanda to see the ambitious goals that have been set for reforestation. As part of an Africa wide initiative, millions of hectares of new forest and agricultural land are set to be planted by 2030.
