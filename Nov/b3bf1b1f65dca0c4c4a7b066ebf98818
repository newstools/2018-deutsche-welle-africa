A Norwegian man has been charged with forcing more than 300 teenage boys to perform sexual acts, state prosecutors in Oslo said late Tuesday. The 26-year-old, identified in the media as a football referee, is alleged to have targeted boys using internet forums and the Snapchat messaging app. Passing himself off as a girl, he reportedly promised to supply erotic photos if his victims agreed to send him videos of themselves masturbating.
