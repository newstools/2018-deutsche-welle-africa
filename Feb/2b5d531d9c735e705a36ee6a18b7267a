A court in Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, has handed a second life sentence to Trinh Xuan Thanh, a former executive of the state-owned oil company, for embezzlement, state media reported. Thanh, who Germany says was kidnapped by Vietnamese agents in a Berlin park last year, was convicted of embezzling $622,000 (€500,000) from a property project developed by a unit of state-owned PetroVietnam, the state-run online newspaper VnExpress said.

Also convicted in that case was Politburo member Dinh La Thang, Vietnam's highest-ranking politician charged in decades. Thang was jailed for 13 years for economic mismanagement. The convictions are a result of Vietnam's widespread corruption crackdown initiated by the ruling Communist Party under the watch of General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong.
