Vonn clocked a time of 1 min 12.84sec, just 0.02 secs faster than overall World Cup downhill leader Sofia Goggia, while Austria's Cornelia Hütter finished third. "It's a big number," said Vonn of her 80th victory. "I remember when I got my 50th win here, I never thought I would get close to Annemarie Moser-Proell's record [of 62 wins]. Now I am getting closer to Stenmark's. It's incredible. I am so thankful that I have gotten myself in a position to get these wins coming into the Olympics." Vonn's time was just good enough to claim victory by two thousandths of a second The 33-year-old is now just six World Cup wins short of matching Ingemar Stenmark's all-time alpine record and will race again in Sunday's downhill race, the final tune-up before the Olympics open in Pyeongchang on Thursday. jt/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)
