Former Labor Minister and current head of the SPD's parliamentary group Andrea Nahles was nominated to take his place in a unanimous decision by SPD leaders, Schulz said.

Should she be elected at a party conference in Wiesbaden in April, Nahles will become the first woman to run the party in its 150-year-history. Nahles faces a challenge for the SPD's top post from Flensburg Mayor Simone Lange. Hamburg Mayor Olaf Scholz, who is slated to become Germany's next finance minister, will provisionally lead the party until the April 22 party congress, according to party sources. Schulz's fall from power Tuesday's announcement caps off a turbulent week for the former SPD leader, after his party agreed a coalition deal with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian allies the Christian Social Union (CSU) last Wednesday. Just two days after the coalition deal was struck, Schulz announced he was abandoning his bid to serve as Germany's next foreign minister after heavy criticism from his party for seeking the job after he previously said he wouldn't serve in the next German government. Schulz has also been criticized by fellow SPD politician and current Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel for pursuing the post. Divisions in SPD The upheaval at the top of the SPD has distracted from party leaders' attempts to convince party members to agree to the coalition deal. The party's 464,000 party members will vote in a postal ballot on the deal, with the results expected to be announced on March 2.

Last year's general election in September saw the SPD receive 20.5 percent — the party's worst postwar electoral result. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
