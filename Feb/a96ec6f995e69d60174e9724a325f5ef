Pakistan's GEO News, citing hospital officials, said the former UN special rapporteur suffered a stroke and died after arriving unconscious in the hospital. An outspoken critic of Pakistan's powerful military establishment, she was placed under house arrest in 1983 and later jailed for campaigning for the restoration of democracy. Years later, she was detained again by the government of then military ruler Pervez Musharraf. Read more: Mashaal Radio shutdown: Is Pakistan suppressing foreign media?
