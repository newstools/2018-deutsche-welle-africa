In their joint online appeal to Merkel's intended coalition, heads of electronic groups such as Bitkom, the association Deutsche Startups, and Germany's Internet business federation, eco, said Germany risked "fatal" consequences if its efforts were not focused. Although promised, neither a single ministry, nor a cabinet post for digitization had emerged in last week's coalition agenda agreed between Merkel's conservatives and center-left Social Democrats, the lobbyists said. "Our schools and universities are stuck in the Cretaceous Age. Government and administrations work analogue.
