The Oscar ceremony held on March 4 in Los Angeles could turn out to be the climax of the career of British cameraman Roger Deakins. Or he might face yet another disappointment. Over the past 40 years, movie fans are likely to have come across some of the images captured by the world's most Oscar-nominated cinematographer. The list of nominated works includes "The Shawshank Redemption," "Fargo," "No Country for Old Men," "True Grit," as well as "The Reader" and "Oh Brother, Where Art Though?" In 2016, Deakins was nominated for "Sicario," but once again ended up empty-handed. Will his 14th Oscar nomination, for his camera work on "Blade Runner 2049," be the winning one?
