Despite two failed doping tests from its athletes at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee has had it's suspension lifted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Wednesday, after no further Russians tested positive for banned substances. "The final notification of all remaining test results from the Olympic Athlete from Russia (OAR) delegation has been received from the Doping-Free Sport Unit (DFSU)," an IOC spokesman said in a statement. "The IOC can confirm that all the remaining results are negative."

A total of 168 athletes were allowed to compete at the Pyeongchang Games under a netural flag and without Russian symbols. Two of those athletes tested positive, something that prevented the IOC from reinstating the country in time to allow Russian athletes to march behind their flag for Sunday's closing ceremony. Of the two athletes who tested positive, the curler, who won bronze in the mixed doubles, was stripped of his medal, as was his teammate. jh/pfd (dpa, AP)
