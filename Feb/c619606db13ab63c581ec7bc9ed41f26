The chair of the Turkish Community in Germany (Türkische Gemeinde in Deutschland) foundation, Gökay Sofuoglu, criticized the planned decision to rename the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of the Interior, Construction and Homeland. He told the daily Berliner Zeitung that "focusing on the term 'homeland' is the wrong emphasis at the wrong time." Gökay Sofuoglu believes that the idea of a "homeland" excludes millions of other people with foreign backgrounds He said the move was problematic because the term "homeland" describes a "different space of experience and emotion from one person to the next." "We're worried, that this term will not promote solidarity and togetherness but rather exclusion and division," Sofuoglu added. He stressed that rather than emphasizing traditional values pertaining to the term "homeland," Germany should foster an inclusive understanding of a pluralistic society, with the Basic Law, Germany's constitution, serving as the common basis of values.

Veteran conservative politician Horst Seehofer is set to be the new interior and homeland minister Scharrenbach said the term "homeland" was not mean to exclude but rather include people: "Homeland means everyone, including those who migrated here, and is not meant to exclude anyone," she told the Berliner Zeitung. In Germany's federal political system, each can decide how it divides up various governmental departments and how it chooses to name them; not all states have a "Homeland Ministry." Following weeks of coalition 
talks  among Germany's largest parties, Christian Social Union politician Horst Seehofer is expected to become the minister for the interior, construction and homeland. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
