With Asian and European equity markets plunging on Tuesday, New York stocks started their trading day with another jaw-dropping fall as the Dow index dived nearly three percent, adding to the previous day's record-breaking loss. But within minutes a fierce battle appeared to be playing out between those betting on a further downturn and those who thought that the market correction had gone too far, leading to some wild price swings.

"The colossal range on the US indices sum up how irrational equity traders are at the moment, and while some go bargain hunting, others are fearful we could see another leg lower." Even as the Dow index gyrated in and out of positive territory, the feeling spread that the worst of a brutal downturn was over. "Dow up! Panic over, as you were everyone," tweeted James Hughes, chief market analyst at AxiTrader, during a brief breather for the index. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, tweeted "Trader's paradise out there right now", in a reference to volatility which boosts brokers' earnings from trading fees.

"We are just seeing some continued selling after a very long period of a complacent environment." European markets keep anxiety at bay Wall Street's partial recovery helped European shares off the day's worst levels, but markets remained deeply in the red at the close. In Frankfurt, Germany's blue-chip Dax index was down 2.4 percent, closing at 12,341 points. Some strategists view it as a healthy pullback after a rapid run-up in the start of the year and strong 2017 gains, and say the improving economic outlook is a positive for stocks overall.

"When you get these periods of intense panic it makes sense to be buying while others are forced sellers but on the other hand you don't know that the negative mood will go away quickly," he said. "The last time we had that degree of panic was August 2015 which was the first of the two Chinese devaluations. At that time it took about eight weeks before the market digested the bad news and started rallying again," he added.

It later recovered slightly to close at just above 21,500 points, down 5 percent. Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 3.9 percent, while Australian shares shed four months of gains in Tuesday's early trading. Top Japanese officials moved to downplay concerns on the trading floor on Tuesday. Finance Minister Taro Aso declined to comment on share prices, but insisted that corporate performances were not getting worse. Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said he was keeping a close eye on market movements, adding that Japan's economy remained stable and improving. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
