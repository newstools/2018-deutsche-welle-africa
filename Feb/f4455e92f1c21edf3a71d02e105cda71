We're very excited to present the 100th episode of eco@africa, bringing you the latest and greatest green innovations from Africa and beyond! For the first time, our hosts Nneota Egbe and Sharon Momanyi are presenting the program together from Lagos, Nigeria. After a warm welcome, we take a look at a Nigerian project and see how it is motivating citizens to recycle – and why it's working! Then we go to Kenya to visit the largest wind farm in Africa. The Lake Turkana Wind Power project is designed to bring clean, affordable energy to a million homes – but not everyone thinks it's a good idea. In Germany, we take a look at a product aiming to reduce plastic waste with a tasty twist! Find out how a startup invented edible drinking straws – and how saving the planet can start with a drink. Back in Lagos, we meet the man behind an innovative community gardening initiative in the city. Sipasi Olalekan Ayodele tells us why his passion for nutrition means he has a healthy respect for nature. Finally, it's off to Zambia where we get acquainted with some of Africa's most fascinating creatures – chimpanzees! Find out how a sanctuary in the north of the country is providing a home for orphaned chimps who can no longer survive in the wild. We hope you enjoy watching our 100th episode as much as we enjoyed making it! Check out the show and let us know what you think at ecoafrica@dw.com. We'd love to hear from you!
