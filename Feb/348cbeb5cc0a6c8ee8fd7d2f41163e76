A rejected Uzbek asylum seeker who killed five people in a Stockholm truck attack on Tuesday said he had hoped to pressure the Swedish government into ending "its participation in the fight against the caliphate, to stop sending its soldiers to war zones." Testifying in court for the first time Tuesday, Rakhmat Akilov added: "I did this because my heart and my soul aches for those who have suffered from the bombings of the NATO coalition." Akilov admitted during the first day of his trial last week to carrying out last April's deadly truck attack in Stockholm. The 40-year-old suspect said he had stolen the beer truck used in the attack, and that he had swerved widely as he drove onto the crowded high street to mow down as many pedestrians as possible.

Three Swedes were killed in the attack, including an 11-year-old girl, as well as a 41-year-old British man and a 31-year-old Belgian woman. Around 15 more people were injured. While Sweden is not a NATO member, it does have some 70 troops deployed in the Middle East, mainly in northern Iraq, tasked with supporting the US-led coalition against the "Islamic State" (IS). Swedes probe potential accomplices Swedish intelligence agency Sapo is still probing with whom Akilov had communicated in planning the attack. Akilov claimed in court it was approved by IS members he had been in contact with on encrypted chat sites. He also maintained not to know the real identity of these people, only their online pseudonyms. Akilov also said he had initially intended to attack NATO-member Denmark, although was ordered to strike Sweden instead by one of his contacts. Ahead of the attack, Akilov said he recorded a video of himself pledging allegiance to the leader of IS. Some 20,000 people gathered on Sergels Torg plaza on Sunday. The "Lovefest" vigil was a sign of unity against terrorism, two days after a truck attack on a busy pedestrian street which killed four people. "Fear shall not reign. Terror cannot win," Stockholm mayor Karin Wanngard told the crowd, saying terrorism would be defeated with "kindness and openness." A police vehicle outside Ahlens department store which was targeted in Friday's attacked was covered in flowers. "I think it's very important to stay strong together against anything that wants to change our society, which is based on democracy," said one Swede who gave her name as Marianne. "We talk, we don't fight." Among the thousands of people at Sunday's vigil were placards proclaiming love and protesting against terrorism. This one reads: "Love for all - hate toward no one." Another woman in the crowd wearing a headscarf held a sign reading: "We don't respond with fear, we respond with love." The usually tranquil Scandinavian nation, which prides itself on its openness and tolerance, was deeply shocked by Friday's attack. Linking arms, under flags flying at half-mast, the crowd at Sunday's vigil held a minute's silence for the four victims. Among the victims were two Swedish nationals. The Foreign Office in London has also confirmed that a British man, 41-year-old Chris Bevington, was among the dead, while the Belgian foreign ministry said a Belgian woman had been killed. Fifteen others were injured, four of whom remain in critical condition. Process an insight into radicalization Prosecutor Hans Ihrman said he was seeking a life sentence against Akilov for charges of "terrorism and attempted terrorism," followed by his deportation. Life sentences in Sweden vary, but are on average around 16 years. Ihrman told the court on Tuesday that he expected the trial to provide a better understanding into the "process of radicalization." Akilov's case, Ihrman said, "fits into a broader framework" of jihadis who are "marginalized in a foreign country" and seek to strike "symbolic targets."

The trial is slated to run until May. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
