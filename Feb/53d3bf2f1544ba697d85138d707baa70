Our featured artist is a German who was born in Russia and began taking piano lessons at age three and gave his first public performance as a four-year-old. Four years later, his family moved to Hanover, Germany. There, Igor Levit later enrolled at the city's Academy of Music Theater and Media and finished his studies in 2010 with the highest point score in the Academy's history. Since 2000 he's given concerts in Europe, the US and Israel. Among other things he's thrilled audiences with his interpretation of Bach's Goldberg Variations, calling the opportunity to grapple with Bach mentally and emotionally one of the gifts of his profession. As Igor Levit explained to DW, a free spirit breathes in Ferruccio Busoni's Fantasia contrappuntistica, yet it is one that is not very far removed from the strict structures of Bach: "The Fantasia contrappuntistica is a basically kind of utopia put into music," said Levit. "Busoni wrote, 'When I imagine a piece, there are no limits. Then I take a pencil in my hand and I start writing things down. That alone restricts the imagination. So how can an interpreter possibly think that what he gets with this piece of paper is the final word?" Freedom and "a beautiful kind of artistic anarchism" are Levit's credos. That might be why his style of playing has a way of stimulating the imagination.
