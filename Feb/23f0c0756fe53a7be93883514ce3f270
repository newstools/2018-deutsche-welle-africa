French President Emmanuel Macron began his first Corsica trip Tuesday with a plea for unity and frank dialogue as he led a tribute to Claude Erignac, France's top official on the island, who was assassinated by pro-independence activists in 1998. During the ceremony, he praised what he called Erignac's commitment to bringing peace to Corsica. "Twenty years later, the republic must preserve this ambition, to bring about a future for Corsica that matches its hopes without compromising with demands that would tear it away from the bosom of the republic," Macron said. The shooting of Erignac, outside a theater in the capital Ajaccio, stunned France and marked a sharp escalation in nationalist violence on the island.

Thousands of Corsican protesters marched in rallies demanding greater autonomy from France ahead of Macron's visit Call for more autonomy Macron was due to meet with nationalist leaders Gilles Simeoni and Jean-Guy Talamoni on Tuesday evening, ahead of a highly anticipated Corsica policy speech on Wednesday. The Mediterranean island, home to some 330,000 people and Napoleon's birthplace, has been part of France since 1768. Separatists launched a violent campaign involving bombings and assassinations in the mid-1970s. But they laid down their weapons following a ceasefire in 2014 to instead seek change through politics.

Other demands include equal recognition of the Corsican language, preferential access to the property market for locals and the release of so-called political Corsican prisoners held in mainland prisons.

He pledged, however, to try to give the island "the future it aspires to, without giving into demands that would take it out of the Republican fold."

Candidates from Macron's Republic on the Move! party won just six seats.

Simoni, the head of the regional assembly, described Macron's visit as "an extremely important moment with the potential to become historic." "If the road to dialogue remains closed we would be in a crisis situation and a political dead-end," he said. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
