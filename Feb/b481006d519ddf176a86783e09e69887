Germany's likely next Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Saturday insisted Berlin would no longer seek to pressure other EU countries over the way their economies function. In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine, Scholz said Germany "doesn't need to dictate to other European states how they run themselves." Scholz, who is expected to clinch the finance role in Chancellor Angela Merkel's next government following a coalition deal between her conservative alliance and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), admitted that "mistakes have certainly been made in the past."

Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) are ceding direct control of two of them. One, finance, is to change from right to left of the political divide, moving from CDU to Social Democrat (SPD) hands. Other switches are likely in less prominent portfolios. The transfer of the Finance Ministry from CDU hands to the SPD is the biggest surprise of the deal. The minister plays a major role at the European level as evidenced by the CDU’s Wolfgang Schäuble during the eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Hamburg Mayor Olaf Scholz, a centrist within the SPD, will likely get the title of deputy chancellor in addition to finance minister. The Interior Ministry, which deals with law and order within Germany, looks set to stay in the hands of Merkel’s conservatives, but not her own CDU. Touted for the position is the leader of Bavarian sister party the CSU, Horst Seehofer (left). The Bavarian party has taken a tougher line than Merkel on immigration. The conservatives suffered losses to the far-right AfD in September's election. Under the deal, the SPD will keep control of the Foreign Ministry. Since 1966, the ministry has been run by a member of smaller coalition partners. Sigmar Gabriel has been in the role in a caretaker capacity since Frank-Walter Steinmeier was elected president. Martin Schulz (above), a former leader of the European Parliament, was expected to take over but pulled out in a bid to quell party unrest. The CDU’s Ursula von der Leyen, a key ally of Merkel who is thought to have her own ambitions to become chancellor, is likely to remain in her role at the helm of the Defense Ministry. The ministry has had a growing importance in recent decades as Germany became more involved in foreign military operations. In particular, the Bundeswehr maintains a significant deployment of troops in Afghanistan. Typically a portfolio that goes to the junior coalition partner, responsibility for the Justice Ministry may well stay with the current incumbent — the SPD’s Heiko Maas. While individual states in Germany are generally responsible for the administration of justice, the federal ministry is charged with making and changing constitution-related laws. It also analyzes laws made by other ministries. Helping to make up for the CDU losing two major offices, the CDU will get its hands on the Economy Ministry, also responsible for energy policy. Merkel's right hand in the chancellery Peter Altmaier (pictured) — who has also been running the Finance Ministry since the departure of Wolfgang Schäuble — is expected to take over from the SPD's Brigitte Zypries. The favorite to take over at the top of the Ministry of Agriculture is the CDU’s Julia Klöckner, who leads the party in the western state of Rhineland Palatinate. Having twice failed in her bid to become state premier there, She’ll be one of the relatively rare new faces in Berlin. The CSU will also retain the Transport Ministry with CSU Secretary-General Andreas Scheuer, from Lower Bavaria, taking charge. He’d also be responsible for digital infrastructure. The party will hold onto the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, with undersecretary in the Transport Ministry Dorothee Bär set to take the reins from current Development Minister Gerd Müller. The Health Ministry remains a CDU concern, with Annette Widmann-Mauz, an undersecretary in the ministry from Baden Württemberg, expected to take over. She’d replace fellow CDU member Hermann Gröhe, who is touted to head up the Federal Ministry for Education and Research. Author: Richard Connor Change in eurozone policy? His remarks were seen as a criticism of former Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, who insisted on strict austerity in heavily indebted EU member countries during the eurozone crisis. Schäuble, who led the Finance Ministry from 2009 until last year, put considerable pressure on Greece to rein in its deficits after the country came close to being ejected from the euro single currency. He also oversaw several years of Germany's ballooning trade surpluses that were widely criticized elsewhere in Europe for deepening the economic imbalances between EU states.

Results are expected early next month. Conservatives worried German media reported growing concerns within Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) about the Finance Ministry portfolio being given to the SPD, as they fear that Schäuble's policy of strict budgetary discipline may be at risk. In the Spiegel interview, Scholz, however, said he would present the country with a balanced budget if he takes over the Finance Ministry. "The Social Democrats are for solid financing," he told the magazine.

But the SPD politician insisted that the new government would not send finances into the red, adding that further investment "would depend on additional growth and the taxes generated from that." Scholz also reiterated in the interview with Der Spiegel that Germany would help meet the funding gaps in the EU's budget resulting from Britain's decision to leave the bloc. But he said Berlin can't shoulder the burden alone. Currently the deputy leader of the SPD, Scholz previously served as labor minister, and since 2011 has held the office of mayor in the northern German city of Hamburg. Merkel's CDU, its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the SPD, took heavy losses in Germany's September 24 election, leading to four months of negotiations to try to a form a new government. The SPD had vowed not to renew its alliance with the conservatives that had ruled Germany since 2013 but reversed its decision after Merkel failed to form a coalition with two smaller parties. On Friday, SPD leader Martin Schulz abandoned his bid to assume the role of foreign minister following the coalition deal with Merkel. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
