Days after finalizing the details of the next government, coalition partners CDU/CSU and the Social-Democrats have hinted at addressing a particular health crisis in the upcoming administration: politicians from both parliamentary blocs said they would plan to combat the growing problem of anorexia among young women by addressing unrealistic beauty standard propagated in advertising campaigns. CSU-politician Dorothee Bär wants to adapt regulations in Germany similar to those in practice in France and Spain "We need legal regulations to protect women from anorexia. There is barely any other illness among young women that has as high a mortality rate as anorexia – and chances of recovery are slim," Karl Lauterbach, the chairman of the Social-Democrats' parliamentary group told the Spiegel news magazine. The Premier of the state of Saarland, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a CDU-politician, also emphasized that laws had to be enacted to clamp down on current advertising standards designed to passively encourage the deadly eating disorder. "Size-zero models present a fake ideal, which is neither aesthetically pleasing nor healthy. This can lead to dangerous long-term physical damage on body and soul, leading all the way to death," she told Spiegel. Standards changing in other countries CSU-politician Dorothee Bär said that attempts to raise awareness had reached their limits, and that pictures of women in publicity campaigns had to return to being representative to realistic standards. "The time has come to take a look closely at regulations in our neighboring countries," she said, referring to laws in France that prohibit underweight women to be used as models. Spain and Israel have meanwhile introduced similar legislation. Read more: French fashion houses ban super skinny models Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
