What the US has said: Trump on Monday demanded the North follow heavy conditions before they could have talks. "They want to talk. We want to talk also, only under the right conditions. Otherwise we're not talking [,...] We'll see what happens. That's my attitude," he said. Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for bolstering China's sanctions against the North and warned that Russia is "behaving badly" on the issue. The US also imposed a new round of sanctions last Friday, What the North has said: A high-level delegation from North Korea has been visiting Seoul and meeting South Korean officials, including Moon, after attending the Olympics' closing ceremony on Sunday. The North has said it is open to talk but has made no indication it is willing to consider denuclearization. When talks are not talks: US officials have differentiated talks from negotiations and said Washington's position is that North Korea must ditch its nuclear and missile programs before any talks can go ahead. jbh/aw (AP, Reuters) Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
