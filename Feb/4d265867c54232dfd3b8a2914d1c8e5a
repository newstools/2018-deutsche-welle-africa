"The incident raises serious concern regarding the lacking emergency contingency plans at the mine for alternative and back-up power generation." "Major multinational corporations like Sibanye-Stillwater which should be industry leaders in creating a safety culture are doing far too little to prevent accidents," a separate union said in a statement. Company spokesman James Wellsted, told local television that the miners were "likely to be tired but I think everyone's okay."

The country has some of the world's deepest gold mines. Sibanye-Stillwater claims to be one of the world's top 10 gold producing companies. Dangerous industry: Five mineworkers died in a collapse at a separate gold mine collapsed outside Johannesburg in August. The union said goldminers "risk life and limb daily." What happens next: Mine operators are working to restore power to the site and evacuate the workers faster than one at a time.
