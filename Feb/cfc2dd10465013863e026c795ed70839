Italy will no longer be obligated to receive all migrants rescued by the European Union's border agency from the Mediterranean Sea after Frontex launched its new mission on Thursday. More than 600,000 refugees have landed in Italy over the past four years and its government has long accused the European Union of lacking solidarity and has criticized the refusal of Spain and France to open their ports to rescue ships carrying refugees.

Political message: The requirement to take refugees to the nearest EU port sends a political message to Italy's Mediterranean neighbors such as Malta, but is unlikely to majorly affect arrivals as Italy coordinates the vast majority of sea rescues between North Africa and its southern coast. Changing patterns "Operation Themis will better reflect the changing patterns of migration, as well as cross-border crime," Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri said in a statement. Activist groups said the EU's focus on stemming migrants has led to terrible conditions in Libya. The Institute for Security Studies and the Global Initiative Against Transnational Crime released a joint report on Thursday criticized the EU for partnering with militia groups. Such a move "creates instability, sabotages the state-building process and further drives the exploitation and abuse of migrants in the country," the institute said. Once a luxury sailing boat, the Astral was donated to Proactiva Open Arms by Livio Lo Monaco, a successful Italian entrepreneur based in Spain. After refurbishing, the Astral started conducting search and rescue operations in the central Mediterranean area on July 1. The Astral crew is a mixed group of experienced rescuers, doctors and sailors, most of them volunteering during their vacation. Many joined the ranks of Proactiva Open Arms in Lesbos (Greece) last year, assisting refugees arriving from Turkey. The team rotates after a two-week mission off the Libyan coast. Several women make it on to the raft boats carrying their babies with them. Many get pregnant after being sexually abused during their journey across northern Africa or at the hands of human smugglers in Libya. Given its small size -30 meters in length- Astral aims to assist refugees until they are transferred to a bigger boat. Here a batch of refugees is taken to the Vos Hestia, a rescue vessel currently operated by Save the Children in the central Mediterranean. Refugees are rarely brought aboard army vessels due to strict military protocols. "Unfortunately, European institutions are missing while they delegate the weight of the rescue operations on the handful of NGOs working in the area," Astral captain Riccardo Gatti told DW. The lack of bigger vessels in the area and bad weather conditions often force Astral to take the refugees to port. On those occasions, they get crammed inside the boat where there's literally no space to lay down and rest. Refugees are taken to southern Italian ports. "Some will ask for political asylum while others will be sent back following immigration agreements between Italy and their countries of origin," Frontex officials told DW. The International Organization for Migration has identified and located around 280,000 migrants in Libya. When there are no bigger vessels around the Astral has to cater for the refugees. Over 15,000 have been assisted by the NGO since last July. Rescue operations are coordinated by the Maritime Rescue Coordination Center based in Rome. Author: Karlos Zurutuza (Libya) What is Frontex? The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders was established in 2005 but 10 years later, during Europe's migration crisis, it transformed into a fully fledged border and coast guard force. Each of the 26 countries in Europe's Schengen Area of visa-free travel is responsible for its own border controls, but Frontex helps across the board. How many refugees are rescued by Frontex? Frontex has rescued 38,000 people in the Mediterranean Sea since 2014. A larger number of refugees are rescued by a flotilla of NGO ships operating closer to the coast of Libya. What next? The new mission starts on Thursday and will run for a year with operational reviews every three months.
