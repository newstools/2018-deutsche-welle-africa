Prosecutors, on the other hand, said the marks on the casings were consistent with the equipment in Haig's backyard workshop.

Las Vegas police have declined to comment on whether the armor-piercing bullets were used in the shooting.

He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 (€200,600) fine if convicted. Authorities have not yet determined what prompted Paddock to open fire on a packed country music festival from his 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay hotel before taking his own life. Investigators believe he might have lost a significant amount of money playing video poker before the killing spree. While analyzing his computer, investigators uncovered searches about firearms as well as "numerous photos of child pornography," Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said in January.
