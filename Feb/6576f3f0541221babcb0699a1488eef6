King penguins, who breed on specific isolated islands in the Southern Ocean, make round trips of more than 600 kilometers (373 miles) in the hunt for fish and krill in the Antarctic waters. While they are away, their chicks go without food for up to a week at a time.

This shift means adult penguins will have to travel farther and farther away from their nests in order to find food, leaving their offspring hungry for longer. Penguins – a favorite animal for many because of their clumsy, waddling gait – offer researchers a useful way to measure the health of their habitat. Christian Reiss, an Antarctic fisheries biologist at the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said: "Penguins are great ambassadors for understanding the need to conserve Southern Ocean resources." Two thirds of the world's 18 penguin species, which range from the volcanic Galapagos Islands on the equator to the frozen sea ice of Antarctica, are in decline, according to a Pew study from 2015. Antarctic penguins in particular are vulnerable to climate change as shifting ice reduces their habitat and warming seas affect their prey. Scientists blame the decline in penguin numbers on intense fishing pressure on forage species such as krill, as well as pollution, damage to penguin breeding grounds, and climate change. Only two types of penguin – the Adélie and the King - are increasing in numbers, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. Penguins live most of their lives at sea but return to land to breed and molt. This makes them important gauges of marine health that are easily accessible to researchers, who can then develop conservation strategies. Stanford University marine scientist Cassandra Brooks said: "Scientists need to continue working to untangle the complex interactions between climate change and penguin populations." The Ross Sea – one of the last intact marine ecosystems in the world, home to penguins – is getting a boost. A deal sealed last year by the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources - an international group tasked with overseeing conservation and sustainable exploitation of the Antarctic Ocean - will see a massive US and New Zealand-backed marine protected area in the Ross Sea. The largest of the 18 penguin species found today are emperors. They are around 120cm tall and weigh about 40kg, although their weight fluctuates through the year. But fossils recovered from the Antarctic peninsula reveal that a huge species of penguin which lived around 37 million years ago would have dwarfed emperors – the ancient penguins may have stood 2 meters tall and weighed up to 115kg. Adélie penguins are one of only five species of penguins that live on the Antarctic continent, the others being the emperor, gentoo, chinstrap and macaroni penguins. Like all penguins, Adélies are excellent swimmers - some have been recorded swimming as far as 300 km (150 km each way) to forage for their chicks. Author: Melanie Hall Difficulty moving nesting sites The flightless king penguin lives in Antarctica and is the second-largest species of penguin, after the emperor. Unlike emperor penguins, the kings cannot nest on ice. "There are still some islands further south where king penguins may retreat, but the competition for breeding sites and food will be harsh, especially with other species like the chinstrap, gentoo or Adelie penguins, even without the fisheries," said Celine Le Bohec, one of the study's co-authors. "It is difficult to predict the outcome, but there will surely be losses on the way — if we are to save anything, proactive and efficient conservation efforts but above all coordinated global action against global warming should start now," Le Bohec added.

Despite offering living accommodation and state-of-the-art laboratories, the huge construct can be moved around the continent with relative ease. Halley VI has been forced to move due to a new crack in the Brunt Ice Shelf that has been growing in size just north of the facility. Although the base is in no immediate damage, they believe it could lead to further cracks and large icebergs breaking off from the sheet. The Halley VI is in the Antarctic to provide information on a wide variety of topics such as space weather, ozone depletion, polar atmospheric chemistry and of course climate change. Famous for being the first research facility to detect holes in our ozone layer, the project is perfectly placed below the auroral zone to study the skies. The large red container in the middle of the facility is used as a communal area for the research scientists. With 70 staff during the summer and just 16 over the winter, it allows those working in the remote location to socialize and take their mind off work from time to time. Due to it's location the Halley VI facility is tasked with working through 24-hour darkness for 105 days of the year and is often cut off from the rest of the world. However that doesn't sound so bad when you have regular viewings of the spectacular Aurora Australis just above. The research facility is made up of eight modules. Each of these modules is built upon hydraulic legs and specially designed skies. When moving the facility each module is capable of being towed individually, making it much easier to get across the continent. Despite the glorious views and exciting research, the climate is often extremely dangerous for humans to live in. At Halley VI the winter months can often see temperatures drop below -20°C and even fall as far as -55°C as the nearby sea freezes over entirely. Concerns over Antarctica's future The researchers say the plight of the king penguin should be a warning about the future of the Antarctic's entire marine environment if action isn't taken soon. Scientists and environmental activists are pushing for the creation of a large marine protection area in the Antarctic. Originally proposed by Germany and now backed by the European Union, the 1.8 million-square-kilometer fishing-free zone, would ban all fishing and protect species, such as penguins, leopard seals and whales. If successful, it would be the world's largest sanctuary by area. The plan was rejected during the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources' annual meeting in 2017. However, the plan will be brought up again for a vote at the organization's meeting this year, which takes place in October. jcg/rs (dpa, AFP) Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
