"Los Zetas, under the command of Guizar Valencia, have murdered an untold number of Guatemalan civilians during the systematic overtake of the Guatemalan border region with Mexico during recent years," the INL said. The arrests and deaths of Zetas bosses in recent years has decimated the cartel's leadership, causing it to splinter into several factions. The cartel is known for its brutality as well as its involvement in drug trafficking, human trafficking and racketeering. Founded by the deserters of an elite military unit, the Zetas' violent acts include piling victims' bodies into roadside gullies and anonymous graves. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
