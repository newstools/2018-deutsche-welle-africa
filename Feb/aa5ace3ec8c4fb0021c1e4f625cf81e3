"People from around 20 countries are working together on this mission," said Reinhard Tlustos, director of the mission simulation, which is called AMADEE-18. The volunteers, who hail from the private space sector as well as from traditional space agencies, will live in igloo-shaped tents, drive rovers and carry out several experiments.

It landed on August 6, 2012 and has since traveled about 17 kilometers (10.5 miles). It is much more than just a rover. Its official name is "Mars Science Laboratory," and it really is a complete lab on wheels. For example, it contains special spectrometer, which can analyze chemical compounds from a distance with the help of a laser; a complete meteorological station that can measure temperature, atmospheric pressure, radiation, humidity and wind speed; and most importantly, a chemistry lab that can run detailed analyses of organic compounds and is always on the hunt for traces of alien life. Curiosity has shown that life would theoretically be possible on Mars. But it hasn't discovered any life, yet. The robot's arm is equipped with a full power drill. Here, it's taking a sample in "yellowknife bay" inside the Gale Crater. The Mars dust is processed by a large number of instruments. First, it's filtered and separated into different-sized particles. Then, those get sorted and sent off to different analytical laboratory machines. Curiosity's predecessors were much smaller. On July 4thm 1997 the small Mars rover Sojourner left its first tire tracks behind - in the dust of the Red Planet. It was the first time a mobile robot had been left to its own devices there, equipped with an x-ray spectrometer to conduct chemical analyses and with optical cameras. Three rover generations. (The tiny one up front is Sojourner.) At 10.6 kilograms (23 pounds), it's not much bigger than a toy car. Its top speed: one centimeter per second. Opportunity weighs 185 kilograms - roughly the equivalent of an electric wheelchair. Curiosity is as big as a small car, at 900 kilograms. The big ones travel up to four or five centimeters per second. Sojourner travelled about 100 meters during its lifetime and delivered data and pictures until September 27th, 1997. This is one of the last pictures of it, taken nine days before the radio connection broke down. Sojourner probably died because the battery did not survive the cold nights. Without the experience of Sojourner, newer rovers could have hardly been envisaged. In 2004, NASA landed two robots of the same model on Mars: Spirit and Opportunity. Spirit survived for six years, travelling a distance of 7.7 kilometers. The robot climbed mountains, took soil samples and withstood winter and sandstorms. Its sibling Opportunity proved more lucky and is still in service today. Opportunity passed the marathon distance of 42 kilometers back in 2015, and to this day, it has covered much more ground than Curiosity. It can take ground probes with its arm. It has three different spectrometers and even a 3D camera. It is currently operating in "Perseverance Valley," an appropriate workplace for the sturdy robot. This panorama was taken by Curiosity's mast camera. The most modern of the rovers will stay in service as long as possible - hopefully at least another five years and much longer. The Martian landscape looks familiar somehow, not unlike some deserts here on Earth. Should we give in to our wanderlust, then - or would it be better leave Mars to the robots? Author: Fabian Schmidt Coping with isolation Two of the biggest questions the mission hopes to answer are how the analog astronauts deal with the physical challenges presented by the terrain and heat, and how they deal with the psychological challenges like teamwork and isolation. "These are things I think can't be underestimated," mission participant and space debris expert Kartik Kumar said. The six researchers will carry out a total of 16 scientific experiments during their Mars simulation, which will include testing a "tumbleweed" robot rover, a new Aouda space suit, and 3D printing parts to repair machinery to growing plants in an inflatable greenhouse.

Communications between the site in Oman and the Innsbruck mission control have also been staggered in a way that will mimic the distance between Earth and Mars. This means it will take 10 minutes for messages from Oman to reach the base in Austria. On Tuesday, US billionaire Elon Musk launched his company's SpaceX Falcon Heavy — the world's most powerful rocket — expanding the possibilities of deep space travel. The launch proved motivating for the group in Oman, who hopes that as the race to put humans on Mars heats up, it will be a cooperative one. "The first person to walk on Mars has in fact already been born, and might be going to elementary school now in Oman, or back in Europe, in the US or China," flight controller for the International Space Station and mission participant Joao Lousada said. rs/bw (AP, AFP, dpa)
