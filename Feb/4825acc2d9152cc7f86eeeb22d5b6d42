The 123 members of Cambodia's parliament who were present on Wednesday unanimously adopted a law that forbids insulting the monarchy, imposing stiff financial and custodial penalties on those convicted of the crime. The changes to Cambodia's criminal law were initially drawn up by Prime Minister Hun Sen, and include a penalty of between one and five years imprisonment, along with fines of 2 million riel to 10 million riel ($500 to $2,500). "An insult is expressed in words, gestures, writing, painting or objects that affect personal dignity," Pen Panha, head of the parliamentary Commission on Legislation and Justice, told the assembly.

"There is a genuine danger that this law will be abusively applied to target those who express legitimate criticism of the royal government, as has been the case in other countries, such as Thailand," said Chak Sopheap, executive director at the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights, in comments to Reuters.
