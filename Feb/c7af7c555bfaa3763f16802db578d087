Turkey's detention of hundreds of journalists, doctors and regular citizens who have been critical of Ankara's operation in Syria's Kurdish-controlled region of Afrin, was condemned by the European Parliament on Thursday. The European Parliament described the arrests as "an attempt to censor criticism" in their resolution.

Harms: Expansion in EU customs union can only happen "if Turkey returns to the rule of law" "The rule of law in Turkey, as we knew it, doesn't actually exist anymore," Harms said. "The level of violence has been raised and there is no more respect for human rights." She added that if the EU's customs union is to be expanded, "it must be made clear that this can only happen if Turkey returns to the rule of law." Thursday's resolution states that the EU's aid funds to Turkey "should be conditional on improving its record on human rights." The resolution also urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government to lift the state of emergency that enables authorities to crack down on critics.
