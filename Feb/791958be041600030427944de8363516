US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, traveled on Wednesday to Amman, Jordan, where he spoke with regional leaders about the war in Syria and the Middle East peace process. Tillerson also signed a memorandum of understanding that extends US foreign aid to Jordan for a period of five years. Under the agreement, Amman would receive $1.3 billion (€1 billion) per year, which represents an increase of $275 million in Washington's annual aid package to Jordan. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi said the aid will help the kingdom "face its economic challenges and meet our developmental and defense needs."

The peace process, however, has not moved forward since US President Donald Trump declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel. Palestinians said the US announcement meant Washington could not be seen as a fair peace mediator. Tillerson meets with Syrian opposition During the visit to Amman, Tillerson also met with members of the Syrian opposition in closed-door talks. The meeting comes in the wake of Russian-sponsored Syria peace summit in Sochi, which the opposition and Kurdish groups had boycotted.
