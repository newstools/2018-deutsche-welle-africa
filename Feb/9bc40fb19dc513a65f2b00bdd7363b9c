Florian Philippot, Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for East France and former right-hand man to France's far-right National Front (NF) leader Marine le Pen held the first Patriotes party congress on Sunday in the northern city of Arras about 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of the capital Paris. "We are building a new force, credible, working, capable of exercising power," Philippot said as he addressed delegates with a plan to stand against the NF in elections and lead France's anti-EU movement. The 36-year-old also spoke out in familiar terms against migration: "Massive immigraiton can no longer continue," he said "because it dries up entire regions, in the countries of origin, it is the opposion of the compassion that we owe to the poorest of of all humanity." The event was held five months after Philippot left the NF because of differences over policy towards the euro and other political issues. Le Pen has attacked the new movement and criticized what she described as Philippot's ambition: "Florian Philippot is not a leader, his movement will not exist," Le Pen said on Sunday.

He found himself under pressure after his call for France to leave the eurozone failed to resonate with voters in the campaign earlier that year. NF has since held back on the issue of leaving the EU, and Le Pen has wanted to rebrand the NF by giving it a new name. Le Pen said the word "front" had military connotations, French news agency AFP reported. Le Pen wants to free the NP of far-right associations. Her father and the founder of NP, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was removed from the party in 2015 for continually dismissing the Holocaust as a "detail" of history. He maintained his position as an honorary member, but a proposal to strike this role is also on the cards for an upcoming congress on March 10-11. He has promised to vote down any efforts to change the party name at the upcoming congress. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
