Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, held a long day of fiery debates stretching into the night on Thursday, tackling proposals and draft laws ranging on a wide array of major issues. Here's what was up for debate: Doctor Kristina Hänel (second from left) was handed a €6,000 fine for posting on her website that her clinic offers abortion services Decriminalizing abortion 'advertising' What was proposed: The Greens and the Left party each proposed draft laws to repeal paragraph 219a of Germany's criminal code. The clause makes it a crime for anyone who publically "offers, announces [or] advertises" abortion services. Those who do so can be jailed for two years or face a fine. The business-friendly, free-market liberal Free Democrats (FDP) recommended amending the clause so that it only penalizes abortion advertising "which is done in a roughly offensive manner." What MPs said: The ban on publically saying that a clinic provides abortion services has created issues for doctors who offer the procedure but who cannot post it on their websites. The Left party, Greens and Social Democrats (SPD) argued that the clause limits women's access to health care information and is no longer "up-to-date." Lawmakers with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), their Bavarian-sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) said they strictly oppose changing the clause. The CDU/CSU opposition means that any change to the ban is likely a long way off. Read more:

The Welt correspondent and former taz column-writer was released from prison last week in Turkey after being detained for over a year. What MPs said: A heated debate broke out in the Bundestag over the AfD's proposal, which was sharply criticized by all other parties. The Green's Cem Özdemir said the AfD's proposal was an attack on press freedom and freedom of speech while AfD parliamentarian Gottfried Curio called Yücel a "hate preacher."The measure was voted down by a large majority of parliamentarians.

The two parties said the register was necessary to create more transparency. The list would be publically available and show who is lobbying the government, which legislation they are lobbying for, as well as what they hope to gain, and which organization they work for. What MPs said: SPD parliamentarians said they would push for a mandatory lobby register should the next coalition government with Merkel's conservatives be approved. CDU and CSU parliamentarians argued against the legislation. According to media reports, the CSU managed at the last minute to remove a lobby register from the coalition agreement between the conservative bloc and the SPD. Read more:

Lobbyists  and politicians: What are the regulations? Germany legalized medical cannabis-use in 2017 Decriminalizing cannabis What was proposed: The Greens presented a bill that would no longer make private cannabis use a crime and instead open a strictly controlled and regulated market for marijuana. The FDP proposed a "cannabis model project" to test private legal marijuana consumption, saying that "repressing" cannabis use has failed. The Left party also put forth a proposal calling for the government to allow the private use of cannabis and to change laws making its consumption illegal. What MPs said: Although Germany legalized medical cannabis in 2017, any moves to fully decriminalize it remain controversial. The SPD was open to the proposals and draft law, but the CDU/CSU as well as the AfD strongly opposed them. AfD MPs argued that they believe cannabis is a gateway drug to stronger substances.

Germany's  medicinal cannabis market struggles with short supply and high costs Most Islamic scholars agree that the hijab, which covers the head and neck, and comes in any number of shapes and colors, must be worn by Muslim women. American teen Hannah Schraim is seen wearing one here while playing with her brother. The chador, which is usually black, is a body-length outer garmet often worn in Iran and among modern-minded women in the Gulf States, as here in Saudi Arabia. It is not fastened with clasps or buttons and therefore has to be held closed by the wearer. A niqab is a veil and scarf that covers the entire face yet leaves the eyes free. It covers a woman's hair as it falls to the middle of her back and some are also half-length in the front so as to cover her chest. Here it is being worn by women attending a rally by Salafi radicals in Germany. An abaya is a loose-fitting, full-length garment designed to cover the body. It may come in many different styles, as seen here at an Arab fashion show, and is often worn in combination with hijab or niqab. The burqa is the most extensive of all Muslim garments, covering the entire body from head to toe. It traditionally has a woven mesh area around the eyes to allow women to see. In this case enabling them to cast their ballots in Pakistani parliamentary elections. Queen Rania of Jordan says that Islam does not coerce women to wear any head coverings, and that it is more important to judge a woman by her ethics and values, rather than what she wears. She is seen here meeting with refugees in Greece. Gallery by Jon Shelton. Full-face veil ban What was proposed: The AfD submitted a proposal calling for a nationwide ban on full-face veils in public, arguing that the full-face and body coverings harm gender equality and that a ban would help the "individual freedom" of Muslim women. What MPs said: Many parliamentarians from other parties criticized the AfD for appearing to champion the cause of women's rights and protecting women when their proposal actually infringes upon their individual rights. FDP parliamentarian Katrin Helling-Plahr said the proposal would actually inhibit certain Muslim women who use full-body and face coverings from leaving the house. "You are not actually helping these women, rather you're robbing their last piece of freedom," Helling-Plahr said. CDU/CSU politicians, appeared to partially side with the AfD, saying that burqas and niqabs inhibit integration measures.
