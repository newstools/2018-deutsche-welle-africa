The US could broaden existing sanctions against Venezuela to cover the South American country's important oil industry. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the goal was to return Venezuela to a democratic path. (05.02.2018) Colombia's president has warned of an unfolding "humanitarian crisis" on the border with Venezuela. Nearly half a million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia to escape economic deprivation and a crackdown on dissent. (14.01.2018) Venezuela's Constituent Assembly has backed plans for a presidential election before April 30, months ahead of schedule. But neighboring countries say the move to allow Nicolas Maduro a second term lacks legitimacy. (24.01.2018) Venezuela's government wants to launch a cryptocurrency this month, but analysts are not giving it much of a chance. Named “petro,” it lacks just about everything that is needed to function as a currency. (08.01.2018) Credit ratings agencies have declared Venezuela and its state-run oil company in "selective default." But Russia has offered to restructure the South American country's debt to ensure Caracas pays its other creditors. (16.11.2017) Dozens of people sheltered from the sweltering sun at the entrance of Cucuta's Ventura Plaza shopping center in a long line, waiting to collect the remittances sent from family members living abroad. The cash withdrawals are a necessity for those looking to continue their exodus to other countries or those who simply need to buy basic staples. This is one of the many interminable lines of waiting Venezuelans that has permeated the landscape of the Colombian border city in the recent months. Milainny Torres waited nervously at the end of a line with about 50 fellow Venezuelans, two hours before the Western Union closed for the day. "I went at 9 in the morning to another Western and they told me the line at this one would be faster, but I've been here for six hours and it is not moving at all," said the 31-year-old woman, who came here from the Venezuelan city of Maracaibo. It took her two days to get to Cucuta, a journey that she takes every two weeks in order to withdraw the $100 (€81) her husband sends from Ecuador. "He left five months ago because we didn't even have enough money to put food on the table with four kids (ages 6, 9, 10 and 13). It's better to travel here and buy everything than to work in Venezuela, where money is worth nothing," she explained. Later in the day, Jose Leon dozed off while sitting on his suitcases. "I come from Maturin, a two-day trip that turned into four days due to delays and problems with our bus," the young man said. He recently arrived from the northeast of Venezuela and planned to continue on to Peru after he withdrawing €50 that his friend from Russia had sent him. The majority of the money transfers come from Spain, the US, Ecuador or Peru. The amounts tend to be around $100, with regular travelers from San Cristobal – a Venezuelan city located just across the border – withdrawing approximately $60 on a weekly basis. Every day scores of Venezuelans line up to exchange money in just over the border in Cucuta The bolivar falls and remittances rise The sending of remittances to the northeastern Colombian state of Norte de Santander and its capital, Cucuta, has doubled in the last year. In 2016, 68.7 million dollars came in within the first three months of the year. In 2017, the region saw a rise of up to 127.8 million dollars in the same time period, according to Colombia's Central Bank. Some 32.5 million dollars were sent from Spain and 26.1 million from the United States. Both countries top the list of sent remittances and the sums from these and all other countries have increased, except those from Venezuela. Remittances from Venezuela represent only 400 thousand dollars and saw a decrease of 1 million dollars. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

  Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/2q4Fj The rapid rise in remittances may be due to an increase in Venezuelan family members living abroad. Absent official data from the Venezuelan government, it is difficult to calculate the Venezuelan exodus, but it is estimated to be in the millions. According to the International Organization for Migration, 606,281 Venezuelans left the country in 2015. In Colombia alone, some 552,000 Venezuelans arrived in 2017, an increase of 110 percent compared to 2016. Cucuta sees itself overwhelmed by the massive increase in financial operations. The city only counts seven cash points: six Western Union offices and the regional Financiera Pagos Internacionales. The large and growing gap between the official and black market exchanges of Venezuelan currency have made the remittances from Colombia rise dramatically in contrast to those in Venezuela. If a person needs to exchange one US dollar in Venezuela, he or she would receive 11,311 Venezuelan bolivares at the official exchange rate set and controlled by the government. Withdrawing one US dollar in Cucuta yields 2,807 Colombian pesos, which on the black market can be exchanged for 100,250 bolivares, according to the parallel exchange rate calculator DolarToday. The exchange of bolivares to Colombian pesos has fallen dramatically since 2013. Back then, one bolivar could be exchanged for 70 pesos, while today it is valued at 0.020 pesos. "It's a waste to come here to exchange bolivares because you get absolutely nothing. The bolivar is just wet paper," complained an elderly man while waiting in line. For this reason, most people that withdraw their remittances in Cucuta spend the money there. They use it to buy basic products or for transportation tickets to other destinations. Even in Venezuela, more and more businesses in border cities are starting to accept only Colombian pesos instead of the local currency. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

Early last year, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro established a currency exchange opportunity at the border. Under the plan, citizens would be able to exchange their pesos for bolivares at a rate three times higher than that of Cucuta. When hundreds of people attempted to do this, the authorized Venezuelan exchange house Italcambio told them they needed to withdraw the money from Titan Intercontinental, a financial institution in Cucuta. Titan Intercontinental told customers that it had no information on this new system and those who managed to receive any money, received it at a lower exchange rate than was promised under the plan. In June of 2016, the Venezuelan government attempted another program that would award Venezuelans foreign currency through a lottery system every two weeks, since foreign currency exchange within Venezuela has been under the control of the state since 2003. For three months, hundreds of Venezuelans crowded ATM machines to withdraw as many US dollars as possible, sometimes until the bills ran out. By September, President Maduro suspended the program, at the same time that US sanctions were leveled against his government. The government then reopened the program last week and the first allotments took place this week. It is possible that the rush to obtain currency, as much of it as possible, occurs again. Despite government efforts, the bolivar to Colombian peso exchange continues to sink. Customs agents carrying out a surprise inspection on a remittance service in Cucuta Prosecuting illegal exchanges The increase in remittances and exchanges has also created a black market for these transactions in the recent months in Cucuta. Tensions boiled in October 2016, when authorized exchange houses ceased their operations to protest the uncontrolled black market exchanges and demand authorities to act. The move managed to extinguish the street-corner cash vendor operations, but a new black market surged. In it, pesos or US dollars are exchanged and transferred directly to customers' Venezuelan bank accounts from the Venezuelan bank accounts of unauthorized exchange agents. The Direccion de Impuestos y Aduanas (Dian), the Colombian tax and customs agency, began conducting investigations and raids in an effort to enforce currency exchange controls. Between 2016 and 2017, some 63 unauthorized exchange operations were being prosecuted and some 365 million pesos in fines have been applied. Violent protests erupted across the country following a Supreme Court decision in late March to strip the legislative branch of its powers. Amid an international outcry, President Nicolas Maduro reversed the decision, but it was too late. Thousands have since taken to the streets to call for new elections. They show no signs of stopping. As of March, Venezuela's inflation rate surpassed 220 percent, according to the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics. The country's largest bill - the 100 bolivar note - was worth just $0.04 at the end of last year. Shopping trips now require stacks, or even bags, of cash to buy the bare necessities. An estimated 80 percent of food items and other basics were in short supply by last year. Venezuelans spend more than 30 hours a week waiting in lines to shop, and are often confronted with empty shelves when they finally enter a store. President Maduro blames the crisis on US price speculation. The opposition, however, accuses the government of economic mismanagement. In Colombia, Venezuelans are collecting medical supplies to send home, as seen in this picture. Hospitals around the country have compared conditions to those seen only in war zones. As patient deaths rise, health officials have sounded the alarm on the rise of malaria and dengue fever. Electricity blackouts and fuel shortages have also driven Venezuelans to desperation. Despite Venezuela's possession of the world's largest oil reserves, drivers face long lines at the gas pump. A 50-percent collapse in oil prices in 2014 devastated the oil-dependent economy. In 2013, revenues were $80 billion. That figure dropped to $20 billion by 2016, according to IMF figures. Lower poverty rates, better education and health, and economic growth: These are all part of the legacy of Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013. Equally part of the socialist's legacy was mismanagement. Not only did he fail to keep the state oil company up to date under increased government control, but his government also overspent despite a drop in oil production after 2006. Chavez's hand-picked successor, Nicolas Maduro, has been in office for four years and has two more to go. The opposition center-right coalition, which has controlled the National Assembly since 2015, has accused him of "abandoning his post" by failing to stem the economic devastation. It has also denounced him for rights abuses. From the governor of Miranda to the mayor of Venezuela's capital Caracas, authorities have attempted to quash anti-government protests by arresting its opposition leaders. Venezuelan authorities have detained Leopoldo Lopez, Antonio Ledezma and Henrique Capriles, considered the face of the opposition movement. Aside from protests, the opposition collected 2 million signatures for a referendum last year, roughly 10 times the number required. And in a move against the Supreme Court - and in lieu of impeachment hearings - it also held a symbolic trial for Maduro. Numerous attempts to stymie its efforts to pressure the government have only emboldened these lawmakers. Since the outbreak of explosive protests in April, scores of people have died and hundreds more have been injured. Rights campaigners say police have arrested thousands. Meanwhile, the government has pushed through with the election of an all-powerful constituent assembly, which critics are afraid will cement Maduro's grasp on power. Venezuela's pro-government constituent assembly has adopted the authority to pass legislation on a range of issues affecting security and sovereignty, effectively taking away the powers of the country's congress, which was under the opposition's leadership. During its first session, the National Assembly fired former top prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who subsequently fled to Colombia. In response to the ongoing political crisis, the United States and European Union have imposed a series of sanctions against ruling officials. The US has blacklisted members of the Constituent Assembly and frozen all of Maduro's assets that are subject to US jurisdiction. The EU, meanwhile, has banned arms sales to the country and is lining up to freeze assets and impose travel restrictions. In November, the oil-rich, cash-poor nation faced its day of reckoning, as officials met with creditors to hammer out a deal to keep the country from defaulting on its debt — estimated to be up to $150 billion. US and EU sanctions, however, have limited the chance of an agreement. Whatever the consequences of a default, creditors will almost certainly go after the country's oil reserves. Author: Kathleen Schuster Dian's Maria Pierina spoke to DW about the situation. "Every financial service institution in Cucuta carries out approximately 8,000 transactions per month," she says, confirming that the rise in Venezuelans' need for cash has led to the troublesome increase in illegal exchanges. DW accompanied one of Dian's operations, where dozens of police agents descended on two illicit exchange houses. One was in a tiny booth inside a hardware store and another in a small back office of a clothing shop. At the hardware store, the owner had just recently finished his day's work and no money was found. At the clothing shop, inspectors uncovered drawers full of cash and counted the bounty, as they informed the owner of the penalties she faced. The Colombian woman cried as she lamented the raid, saying she was trying to transition her illicit operation into a legal business. "I came from Venezuela four months ago with all my savings and this was the only business I was able to open. I pay 2 million pesos in rent, 500,000 in electricity and I barely make 100,000 pesos a day. This affects me a lot because I am now losing everything and I don't even have the money to pay the fine," she explained. The woman added that she "had no intention" of committing fraud or stealing from the government. "I was just transferring bolivares from one Venezuelan account to another, it is legal," she said. The windows of the small shop were covered in advertisements. One read "professional currency trader," another read "transfers to all Venezuelan banks" and another just simply said "Bolivares, bolivares." "Los Animalitos" ("the little animals") is currently the most popular game on the Venezuelan streets. The cheapest ticket for this roulette-inspired lottery costs just 100 bolivars (less than one cent). Bettors have to pick an animal, a number and a color. Winning tickets are chosen several times a day. Most of the people who frequent the lottery kiosks in the back alleys of the capital, Caracas, and across the country are not those one expects to have the disposable income for gambling. Many are unemployed, some are homeless. Even though games like "Los Animalitos" produce more losers than winners, they are the last hope for those feeling hopeless amid the country's massive recession. Eduardo Liendo was among the lucky ones with a winning "Los Animalitos" ticket. The prize money, he told news agency Reuters, "helped me a lot," even though it is bittersweet: Liendo picked the winning animal - a dog - in honor of his deceased pet. The 63-year old recently had to give up his house and has been living in an old car ever since. Venezuela's economy depends primarily on its oil reserves. In the past three years, the price for oil has fallen by more than 50 percent, with dramatic consequences. Inflation and unemployment have exploded. There are not enough groceries and medication for the population. Even middle class families cannot afford to buy sufficient amounts of food and everyday products at black market prices. The economic crisis has been exacerbated by political conflicts. The US has passed sanctions against Venezuela to put pressure on Nicolas Maduro. Washington has accused the Socialist president of trying to turn the country into a dictatorship. In August, the opposition-led parliament was de facto replaced by a constituent assembly run by the Socialists. Bookmakers (along with black market dealers) might be among the few businesses growing in Venezuela at the moment. While there are no official numbers on the gambling industry, which is regulated by a mixture of privately-run companies and regional authorities, insiders told news agency Reuters that lines at lottery kiosks and the like were longer and busier than ever. It's not just the lottery that attracts gamblers in Venezuela, many in the country also place bets on sports. At the La Rinconada Hippodrome in Caracas, there are plenty of men hoping that "their" horse will help earn them a big win. Experts believe it's not in spite, but because of Venezuela's problems that people love to gamble. "In a crisis like the one we're going through, people drink and gamble more to escape from reality," psychologist Rosa Garcia told Reuters. But even at the horse track, Venezuela's economic struggles manage to remain present: The hippodrome in Caracas was built next to a slum, in front of makeshift barracks constructed by the country's working poor.
