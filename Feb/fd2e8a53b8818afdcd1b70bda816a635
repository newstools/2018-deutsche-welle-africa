Regarded as underdogs, the Philadelphia Eagles pulled off a major upset against the reigning Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots, on Sunday night, winning the game 41-33. After running a neck-and-neck game, the Eagles pulled ahead in the fourth quarter and defended their lead despite a last-second "Hail Mary" play by star Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Sunday's victory in Minneapolis is Philadelphia's first Super Bowl win. The team previously lost the Super Bowl in 1981 and 2005. "We knew we had something special," Eagles running back LeGarrette Blount said following the win. The Eagles' quarterback Nick Foles was named Most Valuable Player of the game after leading his team to a victory that was viewed as nearly impossible after the team's starting quarterback Carson Wentz suffered a major injury in December.

Prince played one of the most critically acclaimed musical performances in the history of Super Bowl halftime shows. Timberlake's show included his hits "Rock Your Body" and "Can't Stop the Feeling," but was plagued with audio issues that made it difficult to hear the singer. Timberlake previously performed during the Super Bowl game in 2004, where he accidentally ripped off a portion of singer Janet Jackson's outfit, exposing her breast.
