Read more: Why stock markets crash The prospect of a higher-than-expected rise in US interest rates this year has spooked investors on the ground. Rising wages in the US, coupled with the prospect of inflation, may force the US Federal Reserve to tighten the money supply and increase borrowing costs. However, Europe appeared to have avoided the worst of the share falls seen on Monday in the US and earlier on Tuesday in Asia. According to Unicredit strategists, the greater weight placed by European markets on industrial stocks and financials should see Europe better suited to weather the current financial storm. In the US, however, the recent surge in equities has largely been thanks to volatile technology stocks, the kind of risky assets investors are now looking to dump. Nikkei shares suffer biggest one-day points-drop since 1990 Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average plunged by more than 7 percent in early trading on Tuesday, suffering its biggest one-day points drop since 1990.

All other regional markets were also lower. In the US, about 25 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had recovered to 24,551.76, up 0.9 percent. The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent to 2,668.43, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.7 percent to 7,017.87. Lawmakers unnerved Top Japanese officials moved to downplay concerns on the trading floor on Tuesday. Finance Minister Taro Aso declined to comment on share prices, but insisted that corporate performances were not getting worse. Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said he was keeping a close eye on market movements, adding that Japan's economy remained stable and improving. The Reserve Bank of Australia, the country's central bank, said it would leave cash rates (the interest rate that banks pay to borrow) unchanged at 1.5 percent, citing household consumption as a "continuous source of uncertainty."
