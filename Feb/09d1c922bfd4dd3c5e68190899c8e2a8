ExxonMobil and Chevron posted rare quarterly earnings misses on Friday as cost cuts and rising oil prices failed to offset weaknesses in international refining operations and did not meet Wall Street expectations. Though both companies made billions, it was not enough for investors. Exxon, the world's largest publicly-traded oil producer, reported quarterly net income of $8.4 billion (€6.7 billion), up nearly 400 percent from last year. Revenues rose around 18 percent to $66.5 billion, boosted by a one-time gain from the revaluation of deferred taxes following US tax reform. San Ramon, California-based Chevron, the second-biggest US oil company, also reported a jump in fourth-quarter earnings courtesy of the tax reform and higher oil prices. Earnings came in at $3.1 billion, up from just $415 million in the same period the prior year. For 2017, the company reported a total net income of $9.2 billion.

But analysts hit out at ExxonMobil over its weak oil and gas production output, as well as underperformance in its downstream and chemicals businesses. The results "were weak across the board, with misses in every segment," JPMorgan Chase wrote in a note, which also pointed out that Exxon did not announce any new share repurchases as some had expected.
