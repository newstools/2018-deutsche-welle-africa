Police said initial inquiries indicated that the hauler had rammed the bus after ignoring its right of way. The 72 passengers on a Ryanair flight from Seville, Spain, had just disembarked outdoors on Frankfurt Airport grounds, according to operator Fraport. The bus driver and 13 passengers were hurt. One of them was in serious condition and had been taken to theÂ hospital for additional treatment. It wasn't the first accident this year on the grounds of Germany's largest aviation hub, which last year had 64.5 million passengers. Early in January, a baggage vehicle and an airport passenger bus collided, leaving three people severely injured and eight others lightly injured, according to German news agency DPA. A small bus and a baggage vehicle collided in 2014, injuring five people. Just weeks beforehand, a bus rammed a hauler, injuring 11. Ryanair, a low-cost Irish carrier began operations at Frankfurt last year. ipj/sms (dpa, AFP)
