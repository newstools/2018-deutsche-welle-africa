Despite international outcry at Myanmar's treatment of its Rohingya minority, Thailand continues to hold fast to its promise to not interfere. Asked about Thailand's stance on the Myanmar army's widely criticized "clearance operations" targeting Rohingya civilians in western Myanmar since last August, Thailand's new ambassador to Myanmar, Jukr Boon-Long, told DW his government will continue to back its northern neighbor. Jukr Boon-Long, Thailand's ambassador to Myanmar "Thailand recognizes the rights of Myanmar to defend itself against terrorist attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) that have escalated communal tensions in Rakhine State and triggered the exodus of people from the conflict areas," Boon-Long said. In a stark reminder of the ongoing conflict, three bombs exploded early on Saturday in the capital of Myanmar's Rakhine state. Thailand remains close to Myanmar within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, an organization that follows a policy of not interfering in the affairs of other bloc members. Bangkok has been supportive of the new apparently civilian regime of Aung San Suu Kyi, but at the same time it shares with its northern neighbor a strong military presence within its own democratic institutions and a penchant for placing security over democracy. Bangkok keeping its options open "While sharing the concerns of the international community over what has transpired in Rakhine State, Thailand believes that a constructive engagement with Myanmar, both government and military, is vital," Boon-Long said. The majority of Myanmar's 1.1-million Rohingya population has fled across the border to Bangladesh, following attacks on security posts by insurgents that triggered a military crackdown the UN calls ethnic cleansing.

The UN investigator of human rights in Myanmar recently accused Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi of complicity in the deaths of Rohingya Muslims. Yanghee Lee said it was possible that Myanmar's de facto leader could eventually face charges relating to genocide or crimes against humanity in an international tribunal. The US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley in late January urged the Security Council to ensure Myanmar's military answers for its campaign against the Rohingya. The daughter of Myanmar's assassinated founding father, Aung San Suu Kyi returned to her home country in the 1980s after studying and starting a family in England. She became a key figure in the 1988 uprisings against the country's military dictatorship. Her National League for Democracy (NLD) was victorious in 1990 elections but the government refused to honor the vote. Suu Kyi spent 15 of the 21 years between 1989 and 2010 under house arrest. After 1995, the rights advocate was barred from seeing her two sons and husband, Michael Aris, even after the latter was diagnosed with cancer. Suu Kyi's determination to bring democracy and human rights to her country won her international renown, including the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize. She was so popular that in 2011 famous French director Luc Besson made a biopic of her life starring Michelle Yeoh. She was often called the world's most famous political prisoner. Decades of campaigning finally paid off and in 2012 Suu Kyi was allowed to run in free elections. She won a seat in parliament as Myanmar began its transition away from military government. Since general elections in 2015 she has been the country's de facto civilian leader, although officially she is the foreign minister and state counsellor under President Htin Kyaw. Rohingya are a mostly Muslim ethnic group who had their citizenship revoked by Myanmar's Buddhist-majority government in 1982. Long persecuted, their plight intensified in 2016 when the military began what it calls "clearance" of illegal immigrants - but what groups like Human Rights Watch have described as "ethnic cleansing." Thousands have died and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes. When she became state counsellor in 2016, Suu Kyi set up a commission to investigate claims of atrocities against the Rohingya in Rakhine state. Suu Kyi has accused the Rohingya of spreading "a huge iceberg of misinformation," and that she is concerned by the "terrorist threat" posed by extremists. Her stance sparked protests in Muslim-majority countries around the world. Suu Kyi has been stripped of various honors and lost much of her international support due to her handling of the Rohingya crisis. The Nobel committee was forced to issue a statement saying that her peace prize could not be revoked. Fellow Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai called on Suu Kyi to "stop the violence." Suu Kyi has said that outsiders do not grasp the complexities of the situation. Author: Elizabeth Schumacher Maintaining cordial relations Thailand and the US undertook their annual Cobra Gold military drills in Thailand in February, with Bangkok controversially inviting representatives from the Myanmar military as observers. In mid-February Bangkok awarded Myanmar's army chief a royal decoration, despite allegations of crimes by Myanmar security forces against Rohingya Muslims. The Burma Human Rights Network said Thailand had crossed a "red line" by granting the award. "As a next-door neighbor of Myanmar, Thailand attaches great importance to maintaining a close and cordial relationship between the two countries at all levels and dimensions. This policy remains unchanged regardless of the change of the Myanmar government," Boon-Long said. Two armed ethnic minority groups in Myanmar in mid-February signed a ceasefire agreement with the government and military, the first signatories under the National League for Democracy, headed by Aung San Suu Kyi. The two rebel groups were the New Mon State Party and the Lahu Democratic Union, both based near the border with Thailand. But the majority of 20 armed rebel groups in the country have yet to agree with the government to stop fighting. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

But it has come under increased international criticism after a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) in January was scathing about the conditions of tens of thousands of fishermen in Thailand, most of them poor migrants from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. In response, the US downgraded Thailand in its annual Trafficking in Persons report to Tier 3, the lowest possible status. When asked about Bangkok's policy on undocumented Myanmar workers in Thailand, Boon-Long said Thailand has a long standing policy to respect basic rights and promote welfare of Myanmar workers in Thailand. "They play an important role in driving the country's economy." "Over the years, the two governments have been engaging in constructive dialogues to strengthen labor cooperation and address challenges and issues facing Myanmar workers in Thailand," Boon-Long said. The Thai government has introduced measures to encourage the legal employment of migrant workers and that registration of undocumented migrant workers is expected to be completed on 30 June 2018, he added. "With all of these efforts, Myanmar workers can rest assured that they can work in Thailand while enjoying full rights and benefits under related laws of Thailand," the ambassador underlined.
