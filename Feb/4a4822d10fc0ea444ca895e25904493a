Australian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said on Friday he would step down following controversy about a sexual harassment complaint and an extramarital affair. Joyce, whose National Party is the junior partner in a coalition government with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's Liberal Party, said he would formally resign as both deputy prime minister and leader of the National Party on Monday. The move follows confirmation from the National Party on Thursday of a sexual harassment complaint against Joyce. The 50-year-old lawmaker denied he had done anything wrong.

Joyce is a practicing Catholic and his electoral platforms have focused on promoting "family values." The resulting scandal led the government to a ban on government ministers having sex with their staff. On Friday, Joyce said he would remain a member of parliament, which would ensure Turnbull's center-right government clings onto a one-seat majority. "This partnership [between the Nationals and Liberals] is undiminished and will continue to deliver opportunity and security for all Australians," Turnbull said after Joyce's announcement. The National Party is set to elect a new leader on Monday. The winner will automatically become deputy prime minister under the terms of the coalition agreement with the Liberal Party.
