After several months of excavation work, Egypt's antiquities ministry said on Saturday that an ancient cemetery had been discovered near the city of Minya, south of Cairo. The large necropolis is located 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) north of the Tuna al-Gabal area, a vast archaeological site on the edge of the western desert. The area is known to house ancient catacombs from the Pharaonic Late Period and the Ptolemaic dynasty. Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Enany said the large necropolis, which is more than 2,000 years old, contains a gold mask, 40 sarcophagi — ornate stone-carved coffins, about 1,000 statues — several of them depicting ancient priests, pottery, jewelry and other artefacts.

Five years to finish He hailed the initial find as "important, as it explains several aspects of the life of the ancient Egyptians," adding that excavators would need at least five years to complete the project. Mostafa Waziri, head of the archaeological mission, said eight tombs have been uncovered so far and he expects more will be discovered soon. Four well-preserved alabaster canopic jars were singled out for mention, inscribed with hieroglyphics and designed to hold the mummified internal organs of their owner, who would have been a high priest of the ancient Egyptian deity Thoth, the god of the moon and wisdom. The priest's mummy was also found decorated with blue and red beads and bronze gilded sheets. Archaeologists from Egypt and missions from the German cities of Munich and Hildesheim took part in the excavation. Excavators had to work in challenging conditions to uncover the contents of the burial site in Minya Work began in the area late last year as part of a project to find the remainder of the cemetery of Upper Egypt's 15th nome (district) during ancient times. Ancient Egypt was divided into Lower, Middle and Upper Egypt, which each region having around 20 nomes.

Earlier this month, a 4,400-year-old tomb was discovered near the famed Giza Pyramids south of Cairo. The tomb is that of a female priest called Hetpet from the pharaonic Fifth Dynasty. Late last year, several tombs were uncovered in the southern city of Luxor, on the west bank of the Nile, in a cemetery for noblemen and top officials In March last year, a massive colossus was also unearthed in Cairo, believed to depict 26th-dynasty King Psamtik.

It is due to be partially opened later this year. Help tourists return The discoveries could help turn around Egypt's battered tourism image following the political turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising against long-time dictator Hosni Mubarak.

Although tourism rebounded sharply last year, the 8.3 million arrivals were still almost half the number who visited Egypt in 2010, before the uprising. In 2015, French researchers detected a possible void above a descending corridor. But after several instances in recent years of supposedly newly-discovered pyramid chambers that remained unproven, the researchers sought to back the clue up with quantifiable proof. Now it's official: there is indeed a gap within the structure. But is it a chamber? In May 2016, scientists set up a device in front of the Cheops Pyramid that can register muon particles, a byproduct of cosmic radiation. Measurements revealed a void at least 30 meters in length (99 feet) within the largest pyramid at Giza. The French and Japanese scientists installed detectors in the Cheops Pyramid's interior passageways as well. Muon particles function like x-rays in a human body but can penetrate hundreds of meters of rock. A small portion are deflected — and the differing quantities of particles passing through the stone allow researchers to draw conclusions about wall thickness. Located on the west bank of the Nile at the edge of the Egyptian desert about 20 kilometers (13 miles) from Cairo's city center, these pyramids are the last surviving ancient wonders of the world — and the largest made by man. They are among the best known and oldest structures of humanity, dating back over 4,500 years. This photo of the sphinx in front of the Cheops Pyramid was made in 1963 before it had been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. That happened in 1979, when the Cheops Pyramid and many others were inducted as part of the complex titled "Memphis and its City of the Dead — the Pyramid Fields from Giza to Dahshur." Back in 1335, a monk from Lower Saxony named Otto von Nienhusen visited the pyramids of Giza and was able to view the interior of the Cheops Pyramid. In the late 18th century, British and German archaeologists began exploring it. Now there's fresh hope that new scientific methods can reveal tunnels and perhaps even grave chambers.
