A German ex-priest was handed an eight-and-a-half year sentence on Thursday for 108 cases of child sexual abuse and other offenses. The unidentified 53-year-old man will be detained in a psychiatric institution, with any possibility of future release depending on the outcome of therapy, a regional court in the southeastern town of Deggendorf ruled. The judge said his treatment would take many years and its success was doubtful, but that a guilty plea had increased his chances of eventual release.
