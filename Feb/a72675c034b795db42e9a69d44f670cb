The Brexit adviser to the UK opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said Sunday that the party unanimously favored remaining in the EU customs union in order to cushion the potential economic blow caused by Brexit. Starmer told the BBC that although an exit from the EU's current customs setup was inevitable with Brexit, the UK should negotiate a new deal that "will do the work of the customs union."

The announcement follows a letter published on Sunday in the UK's left-leaning Observer newspaper in which 80 senior Labour Party figures warned that leaving the customs union would be so damaging to the country's economy that Labour would be unable to carry out its ambitious reforms if it came to power. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is expected to elaborate on his party's revised Brexit stance on Monday.

May's hard-line stance, however, has divided senior figures in her party and the Cabinet over what Britain's relationship with the EU should look like after it leaves the bloc in March 2019.
