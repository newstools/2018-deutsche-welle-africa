The United States is investigating whether the Syrian government recently used sarin gas in attacks on the opposition, US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said Friday. "We have other reports from the battlefield from people who claim it's been used," Mattis said, adding the US currently had no proof to back the claims. "We're looking for evidence of it, since clearly we are dealing with the Assad regime that has used denial and deceit to hide their outlaw actions," he said.

On Thursday, the US State Department said it was "extremely concerned" about reports of an imminent chlorine gas attack against an opposition-held suburb outside of Damascus. The AFP news agency also reported senior officials had said the US was not ruling out military force in response to future chemical weapons attacks by the Syrian government.
