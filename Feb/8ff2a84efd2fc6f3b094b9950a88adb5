World Trade Organization (WTO) Director General Roberto Azevedo has warned that the threat of trade wars has increased since the 2008 global economic crisis. Azevedo shared his views on the current international trade climate in an interview in Geneva with news agency DPA published on Saturday. "Trade wars can come up at any time, and in ways that we don't expect," he warned. The WTO chief spoke favorably about globalization and insisted that he did not see an alternative to it in world trade. Azevedo considered that fears of job losses because of globalization were "misguided".

But the reality is that 80 percent of the jobs that are being lost today are lost due to new technologies, to innovation, to new managerial strategies," he asserted. Azevedo said he missed the "constructive spirit" that the US had exhibited toward international commerce in the past. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

China-US tariff tension Azevedo's comments came amid increasing tension between the US and China over tariffs, trade rules and protectionism. In January, Washington announced the application of high import tariffs on washing machines and solar power equipment to protect domestic jobs.

On Friday, the US complained about a new Chinese internet-access rule to the WTO. The new Chinese regulation, to take effect next month, would create significant restrictions for cross-border service suppliers, the US argued. Washington has also been critical of the 164 member organization. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
