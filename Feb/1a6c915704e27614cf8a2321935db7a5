Roma's early confidence started to ebb away as Shakhtar took control of the game and were rewarded for their second half display when Fred lifted a wonderful free-kick over the Roma wall and beyond keeper Allison Becker via the underside of the bar. Becker saved Roma from a heavier defeat with a stunning stoppage time save from Ferreyra, who seemed certain to score with the goal gaping.
