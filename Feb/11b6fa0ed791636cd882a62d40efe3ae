The Russian pilot who was shot down in Syria at the weekend commit suicide with a grenade before he could be captured by Syrian rebels, the Russian defense ministry said Monday. Russian authorities have now lionized the pilot's death, seizing a propaganda victory from Syrian rebels who dramatically shot down the Sukhoi Su-25 jet involved in a major push into Idlib province.

"This is for the criminal invaders to know that our skies are not a picnic for them and they cannot cross through without paying the price," Mahmoud Turkistani said in comments carried by the Ebaa news agency, an outlet seen as close to the rebel group. "The pilot died heroically," said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. "We are proud of our heroes." Russia intitially said that Islamist rebels had killed Filipov. Peskov also said: "It's extremely worrying that shoulder-launched surface-to air missiles are in the hands of the terrorists." Read more: Are Turkey and Russia at odds in northern Syria? Much of Raqqa, once an "Islamic State" stronghold, now lies in ruins. What remains of the city are destroyed building shells of concrete and mangled steel. Local traffic uses hastily cleared paths and roads to avoid any hidden IED’s (improvised explosive device). Families use various modes of transport to get around the city. These include bicycles, motorcycles or a home-made wheelie box shown in the image above. A familiar sight on the region's roads and streets: Here three young girls, two adults and a child squeeze on to a small motorcycle. It’s the quickest way to get around town. Small rowing boats ferry people and goods across the river. Local say the Raqqa bridge over the Euphrates river was destroyed by IS forces in a preemptive strike to slow down the Syrian Democratic Forces approaching the city. Teams of manual workers sit on street corners. With people returning to the city eager to rebuild their homes, these workers are in high demand. Coffee, soft drinks and energy drinks are in high demand among the laborers drafted in to rebuild homes and businesses. The owners of make-shift food and drinks carts are doing brisk business. A typical view of a residential area in one of the city’s neighborhoods. A woman with her two children walks past a family that has recently returned home. The father has rebuilt the apartment’s outer walls but with no running water and electricity, many obstacles remain. As the sun sets a family arrives where a block of flats once stood. Each collapsed floor rests on the one below. Rummaging through the rubble two men covered in dust manage to salvage a king-sized mattress. A few moments later the father finds his son’s school book. Two boys walking down one of the city streets hold two used shells. IED’s still present a real threat and are a common cause of death and injury. IS fighters booby-trapped bodies, money, toys and rubbish among other things. Author: Filip Warwick (Raqqa) Why are Russian jets in Idlib? Idlib province is one of the last rebel-held bastions in the country. Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air support and Iranian arms, have intensified their offensive in Idlib in recent months and days. Rebel-held areas have been targeted in at least 50 airstrikes since early Saturday, according to an independent monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Who are Hayat Tahrir al-Sham? Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) are a Salafist jihadi alliance led by the al-Qaida linked al-Nusra Front. In recent months they have ousted more moderate rebel groups from Idlib. Hundreds of thousands of people displaced by Syria's seven-year-old civil war are also living in Idlib. How did HTS shoot the jet down? According to Russia, the plane was most likely hit in its right engine with a heat-seeking missile shot from a hand-held launcher, such as a Soviet-designed Strela or an American Stinger. The jet was probably flying close to the ground, and since the incident Russia has ordered its warplanes in Syria to fly higher. What happens next? Russia will continue its bombing campaign. Meanwhile Turkey is moving closer, after launching a fresh offensive against Kurdish fighters two weeks ago into neighbouring Afrin region.
