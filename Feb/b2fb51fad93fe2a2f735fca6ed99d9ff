Spanish police uncovered a major Barcelona sex trafficking ring on Monday. During the raid, authorities arrested eight men and one woman suspected of running the organization, and freed three young, impoverished Venezuelan women who had been lured to Spain while still living in Venezuela. The ongoing economic decline in Venezuela has led to an upswing in traffickers preying on desperation. These young Venezuelan women had agreed to work off a debt of three thousand euros after being promised that their travel arrangements and costs would be taken care of. The traffickers had promised them that upon arrival in Spain, they just have to work "a short amount of time" to pay back the money but would then be free of the obligation and free to start their new lives. The reality, however, was starkly different. Upon arriving in Barcelona, the life they faced was a living hell of exploitation, intimidation and coercion. The women were forced to cover their housing weekly trough their earnings and overworked, subject to comply with any of the demands of their overseers.

  Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/2iDp2 Vulnerability leads to cycle of violence SICAR Cat, a religious organization in Catalonia that provides help to victims of sex trafficking, is keenly aware of this phenomenon. Spokeswoman Rosa Cendon confirmed to DW that the number of Venezuelan women falling pray to organizations like these has been on the rise in the Spanish autonomous region. "The trafficking rings take advantage of these situations of vulnerability," Cendon explained. Venezuela's dire situation of hunger, high inflation, and scarcity set the stage for an elevated risk of human trafficking. "The situation in the country is pushing people to seek a better future," she added.

Their vulnerability leads them to seek out some form of escape or other options abroad; the bitter irony is that these women end up becoming victims twice, stuck in a vicious cycle. "In many cases, we have seen women who were already fleeing gender violence," Cendon noted. Violent protests erupted across the country following a Supreme Court decision in late March to strip the legislative branch of its powers. Amid an international outcry, President Nicolas Maduro reversed the decision, but it was too late. Thousands have since taken to the streets to call for new elections. They show no signs of stopping. As of March, Venezuela's inflation rate surpassed 220 percent, according to the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics. The country's largest bill - the 100 bolivar note - was worth just $0.04 at the end of last year. Shopping trips now require stacks, or even bags, of cash to buy the bare necessities. An estimated 80 percent of food items and other basics were in short supply by last year. Venezuelans spend more than 30 hours a week waiting in lines to shop, and are often confronted with empty shelves when they finally enter a store. President Maduro blames the crisis on US price speculation. The opposition, however, accuses the government of economic mismanagement. In Colombia, Venezuelans are collecting medical supplies to send home, as seen in this picture. Hospitals around the country have compared conditions to those seen only in war zones. As patient deaths rise, health officials have sounded the alarm on the rise of malaria and dengue fever. Electricity blackouts and fuel shortages have also driven Venezuelans to desperation. Despite Venezuela's possession of the world's largest oil reserves, drivers face long lines at the gas pump. A 50-percent collapse in oil prices in 2014 devastated the oil-dependent economy. In 2013, revenues were $80 billion. That figure dropped to $20 billion by 2016, according to IMF figures. Lower poverty rates, better education and health, and economic growth: These are all part of the legacy of Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013. Equally part of the socialist's legacy was mismanagement. Not only did he fail to keep the state oil company up to date under increased government control, but his government also overspent despite a drop in oil production after 2006. Chavez's hand-picked successor, Nicolas Maduro, has been in office for four years and has two more to go. The opposition center-right coalition, which has controlled the National Assembly since 2015, has accused him of "abandoning his post" by failing to stem the economic devastation. It has also denounced him for rights abuses. From the governor of Miranda to the mayor of Venezuela's capital Caracas, authorities have attempted to quash anti-government protests by arresting its opposition leaders. Venezuelan authorities have detained Leopoldo Lopez, Antonio Ledezma and Henrique Capriles, considered the face of the opposition movement. Aside from protests, the opposition collected 2 million signatures for a referendum last year, roughly 10 times the number required. And in a move against the Supreme Court - and in lieu of impeachment hearings - it also held a symbolic trial for Maduro. Numerous attempts to stymie its efforts to pressure the government have only emboldened these lawmakers. Since the outbreak of explosive protests in April, scores of people have died and hundreds more have been injured. Rights campaigners say police have arrested thousands. Meanwhile, the government has pushed through with the election of an all-powerful constituent assembly, which critics are afraid will cement Maduro's grasp on power. Venezuela's pro-government constituent assembly has adopted the authority to pass legislation on a range of issues affecting security and sovereignty, effectively taking away the powers of the country's congress, which was under the opposition's leadership. During its first session, the National Assembly fired former top prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who subsequently fled to Colombia. In response to the ongoing political crisis, the United States and European Union have imposed a series of sanctions against ruling officials. The US has blacklisted members of the Constituent Assembly and frozen all of Maduro's assets that are subject to US jurisdiction. The EU, meanwhile, has banned arms sales to the country and is lining up to freeze assets and impose travel restrictions. In November, the oil-rich, cash-poor nation faced its day of reckoning, as officials met with creditors to hammer out a deal to keep the country from defaulting on its debt — estimated to be up to $150 billion. US and EU sanctions, however, have limited the chance of an agreement. Whatever the consequences of a default, creditors will almost certainly go after the country's oil reserves. Author: Kathleen Schuster Correlation in human trafficking, asylum figures A rise of asylum seekers in any given country correlates with a rise in human trafficking victims, Cendon said, pointing out that in Catalonia, as asylum seeking applications have increased, so have the number of cases of sexual trafficking of Venezuelan women. According to provisional data from Spanish authorities, Venezuelan nationals top the list of asylum seekers. In 2017, some 10,600 asylum applications were filed by Venezuelans. The number far exceeded the other countries at the top of the list: Syria (4,300), Ukraine (2,300) and Algeria (1,200). Read more: Could there be a Venezuelan refugee crisis?

Cendon added that, makes matters worse, seeking asylum in Europe generally has been marred by obstacles. "The fact that certain countries have blocked the possibility of seeking asylum at their embassies is having the effect of increasing human trafficking," she argued. The Spanish Law of Asylum passed in 2009 presents a paradox: legally, it guarantees asylum seekers the right of passage from their country of origin to Spain in order to formally request asylum, but lawmakers have not yet written the legal terms and conditions for this to happen. Thus, while asylum seekers have a legal right to be provided with safe passage, there is no procedure with which to carry this out. In the end, they have to find a way to flee on their own and this is where the human trafficking organizations lure them in.

Combatting trafficking 'the state's responsibility' One of the biggest obstacles to tackling the reality of sexual exploitation or other kinds of human trafficking is understanding the scope of the problem. SICAR Cat charges that while Spain in principle guarantees basic rights to people who have been victims of trafficking, the government only speaks of about 14,000 "potential victims" of sexual trafficking overall, and of those only 50 foreign victims per year are recognized and granted basic rights including a living and working permit. The organization calls this number "ridiculous" and argues that this wide gap is a result of government inaction. Human trafficking is considered to be the "second most lucrative" practice worldwide and while the Spanish government pledges funds to fight it, Cendon says the amount the government provides is nowhere near adequate; her organization argues that much more resources for protection of victims and persecution of criminals are needed, as well as education and development funds. Ultimately, the organization decried that this delicate issue has been left mostly to be dealt with by NGOs. "Human trafficking is a violation of human rights and as such it is the state's responsibility," Cendon affirmed. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
