A fire broke out on Saturday at Lhasa's Jokhang Monastery, one of the holiest sites for Tibetan Buddhism. There were no reports of any casualties and the extent of the damage was unclear. The official Tibet Daily said part of the more than 1,300-year-old monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, caught fire in the early evening. "The fire was quickly extinguished, there are no casualties and order is normal in its environs," the newspaper said on its WeChat account. The streets around the monastery was temporarily closed after the fire and but have been reopened to pilgrims, the state Xinhua news agency said on Sunday.
