On Monday, more than 100 investigators combed through the wreckage of a plane crash that killed all 71 people onboard shortly after takeoff from Moscow's Domodedovo airport. Heavy snowfall forced workers to search the crash site, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of Moscow, on foot and on snowmobiles as they looked for human remains and clues to what caused the incident. "We plan to carry out the main stage of the search operation in seven days because the plane debris is scattered over a very large area," Emergency Services Minister Vladimir Puchkov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

The pilots sent no distress signal before the plane went down. The crash killed six crew members and 65 passengers.
