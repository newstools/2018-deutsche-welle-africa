They added that the casualties were taken to hospitals for treatment. Heavy gunfire followed "The explosions terrified dozens of families living in the area that hurried to the street to look for their children," eyewitness Gamal Mahdi told the AP. He added that the explosions were followed by heavy gunfire. Other witnesses said that militants tried to storm the camp before detonating the bombs but failed. Photos surfaced following the explosion showing the charred vehicles and clouds of heavy smoke hovering over the area. Yemen-based freelance reporter and graphic artist, Ahmed Jahaf, posted images to Twitter of the scene following the attack.

The southern city has been the temporary seat of Hadi's government since 2014 when Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, seized Yemen's capital Sanaa and forced him into self-exile. A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in support of Hadi in March 2015 against the Iran-allied Houthis, in a war that has killed more than 9,200 people and driven the country to the verge of famine.
