The final four for the German Cup was decided on Sunday and Bayer Leverkusen drew the short straw, Bayern Munich. But they will at least host the record German champions. With an 18-point lead in the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich are on course to win a domestic double, perhaps even a treble if they can win the Champions League as well. History is on their side too. Even though they didn't win the German Cup last year, they have the most titles in the competition's history (18). The other semifinal sees Schalke host last year's runners-up Eintracht Frankfurt. Schalke last won the Cup in 2011, but haven't been in the final four since then. Bayer Leverkusen lost the 2009 final to Werder Bremen - and haven't come close to repeating that feat until now. 962737417588527109
