Levashov was concerned that US investigators would force him to turn over confidential information to US authorities. The Spanish judges eventually rejected these arguments. Levashov could face up to 52 years in prison if he is convicted of the charges at trial. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
