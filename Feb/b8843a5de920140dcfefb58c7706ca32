Austrian public broadcaster ORF has taken legal action against vice chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache after he shared a Facebook post claiming the broadcaster and one of its most prominent journalists publish "lies." In a statement forwarded to DW on Wednesday, the broadcaster said it took the unusual step against Strache, who also heads the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), due to libelous and "untrue attacks on the ORF." "The text discredited the journalistic work of 800 ORF journalists in television, radio and online," ORF Director General Alexander Wrabetz said in the statement. ORF is also suing Facebook for not removing the original post shared by Strache, Wrabetz said.

"There's a place where lies become news. It's the ORF," the text of the picture reads, mimicking an advertisement for the broadcaster. The text continues: "The best of fake news, lies and propaganda, pseudo-culture and forced licensing fees. Regional and international. On TV, radio and the Facebook profile of Armin Wolf." Armin Wolf, the ORF television presenter pictured and mentioned in the post, is also suing Strache. The vice chancellor has since taken down the post and offered an apology to Wolf and said the comments were "satire."

"Yes we want an ORF reform for a future independent, objective and neutral public broadcaster," Strache wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

The anti-immigration party's position in a coalition government with Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives means that the party's proposals have a better chance of coming to fruition. Scott Griffen, the Deputy Director of the International Press Institute, told DW that the FPÖ's rhetoric towards the broadcaster is "problematic" and that the party is "undermining critical journalism and harassing critical journalists." Whatever ORF reform proposals the Freedom Party brings forward "need to be closely examined and scrutinized to make sure there's not a back door to bring the broadcaster to heel," Griffen said.

"One way is to do more work educating the public about what a public broadcaster is and what it isn't," Griffen said. "A public broadcaster is not a government spokesman, it's not a tool of those in power — it's a tool of the public." Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
