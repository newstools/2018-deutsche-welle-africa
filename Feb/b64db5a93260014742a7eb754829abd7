Germany's Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot claimed a gold medal and a world record score in their free skate performance at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics on Thursday. The pair, sitting in fourth place after Wednesday's short program, took the gold after pulling off a flawless routine and scoring a massive 159.31 points. The routine gave them a total of 235.90 points, catapulting them from fourth to first place. The German pair collapsed and cried on the ice after the performance. China's Sui Wenjing and Han Cong of China finished in second, while Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford of Canada took the bronze. The win marks Germany's first gold medal in the pairs since 1952. It was also Germany's eighth gold after just six days at Pyeongchang, equaling the total number it picked up during the entirety of the Winter Games in Sochi four years ago. dm/aw (AFP, dpa, Reuters)
