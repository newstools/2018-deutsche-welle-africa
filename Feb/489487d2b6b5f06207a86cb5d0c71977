New York state prosecutor Eric Schneiderman is seeking financial compensation for victims of sexual harassment and abuse who had worked under Harvey Weinstein. The civil rights lawsuit targets the 65-year-old producer, his younger brother Robert, and the movie studio founded by the pair where many of the incidents allegedly took place. Employees of Weinstein's studio were working "under a persistent barrage of gender-based obscenities, vulgar name-calling" and "threats of violence," Schneiderman said in the lawsuit filed on Sunday. The studio was forced to fire Harvey Weinstein amid numerous reports of sexual misconduct last October. According to Schneiderman, Weinstein also threatened his employees that he would "kill" them and their families, and boasted about his contacts among political figures and the US Secret Service that could "take care of problems."

The company allegedly flew one employee from London to New York to teach his assistants "how to dress and smell more attractive" to the producer. Also, female CEOs of the company were required to meet Weinstein's sexual partners in order to follow up on promises of job offers. Read more: What do Europeans consider sexual harassment?

While the movie producer "was not without fault, there certainly was no criminality," Brafman said. Racing ahead of the sale In recent days, US media reported that the troubled movie studio was to be sold off to a group of investors for about $500 million (€407 million). Prosecutors said that they filed the lawsuit on Sunday for fear that the sale could leave the employees without adequate redress. "Any sale of The Weinstein Company must ensure that victims will be compensated, employees will be protected going forward, and that neither perpetrators nor enables will be unjustly enriched," Schneiderman said. Separately from the New York case, the district attorney's office in Los Angeles recently reported that police had submitted three Weinstein sexual assault cases to them. dj/jm (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)
