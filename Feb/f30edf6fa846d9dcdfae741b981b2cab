The increasingly short lifespan of products, particularly electronics, is a double scourge: to the environment in the form of e-waste, and to the consumer who must constantly replace short-lived items with new ones. Now, a French politician has proposed a new label for products to inform consumers about their durability, traceability, eco-design and recyclability. Poirson (middle) wants to convince the European Union to adopt a Europe-wide durability label Brune Poirson, who is Secretary of State to the Minister for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition in Emmanuel Macron's government, said the labels would "give the French the means of a more responsible consumption, more favorable to their budget." But analysis shows that consumers are far more interested in the latter than the former. And that may be the fatal flaw in the labels Poirson is envisioning. At a time when many consumers suspect that manufacturers are engaging in "planned obsolescence" — that is, purposefully designing products to break down quickly so consumers will have to buy new ones — the idea is likely to be popular with the public. France tried to introduce such legislation in 2015, but it proved unwieldy. A similar idea was put forward that same year in Germany, but it, too, fizzled out. Measuring durability is an inexact science, and creating easy-to-understand labels that combine the factors of both lifespan and sustainability may not be possible, some experts think. E-waste is a growing problem around the world 'Confusion for the consumer' The proposed labels would rate products on a scale, say from 1 to 10, aggregating a number of different factors like ease of repair, durability and sustainability. Stephane Arditi, coordinator of the Cool Products campaign for sustainable shopping in Brussels, says that while the intention is good,  implementation would be far more complicated than it might seem. "The criteria they will use is not clear," he told DW. "An aggregated, multicriteria label can create confusion for the consumer." Perhaps a company places a large amount of information about the product's sustainability on their website, giving the product a high score. But if the information doesn't actually help to make the product last longer, this wouldn't be of much use to the consumer. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

"If you include recyclability in the label, that's not a bad idea," he said. "But having an appliance be easily recyclable is not the same as an appliance that lasts long," he pointed out. Arditi said it would be better for a variety of labels rating different criteria, but of course that would be impracticle to fit on packaging. Poirson has suggested adding a QR code, which consumers could scan with their smart phones to find out how the score was calculated. But how many people would really bother to do that? Green consumers While voluntary certification schemes for environmentally friendly products already exist, such as the EU's ecolabel and Germany's Blue Angel scheme, created in 1978 — the oldest such label around — so far there has been no label that specifically measures product lifetime and durability. Kathleen Jacobs, a researcher at Alanus University in Germany, has conducted a pilot study into how consumers would react to a hypothetical product lifetime label. It was framed as a label that was not a guarantee, but simply an indication of expected lifetime, and would be tested by an independent agency. Blue Angel, a voluntary environmentally-friendly label, has existed in Germany since 1978 Although 33 percent of the consumers surveyed placed importance for their purchase decision on price, 31 percent said a product lifetime label, if it existed, would be a factor. Less than 10 percent would factor in energy consumption into their buying decision — this label already exists across the EU. Durability of products has decreased over the years, she pointed out. "Maybe a label could kick [competitors with low product lifetimes] out of the market." But the research also indicates subtleties. "Only a small group of people who have 'environmental concern' make decisions based on protecting the environment," she says. "The preference for durability is driven by both sustainable values and egoistic motives, such as saving money." Results of Jacobs' full-scale research will be ready by the summer — the key question is what consumers would pay for such information, particularly on recyclability, which has no immediate economic benefit for the consumer. "The market for a sustainability label is bigger, because it attracts not only those who want to help the environment." In 2017, the European Economic and Social Committee published research on how consumers would react to a "long-lasting" label in various product categories. It found that sales of suitcases would increase by 128 percent, printers by 70 percent and smartphones by 41 percent. Mandatory labels showing a product's energy efficiency already exist across the EU Cost and legal hurdles But durability tests for a labeling scheme, whether they are conducted by the companies themselves or by independent authorities, are expensive. Somebody has to pay for them — and those costs are usually passed on to the consumer. This was the case with new EU minimum lifetime requirements for lightbulbs, in which required testing drove up the price. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

Poirson's proposal would be only voluntary, because under EU law, France could not introduce a required national label. "France already in the past tried to introduce an environmental label for products on the market, but was challenged by the EU, which said it was a distortion of the single market," Arditi explained. A national agency would face challenges along that route. "But we encourage France to be brave on this, to try it," he added. Jacobs said she would push for a mandatory label to be adopted at the EU level, and pinned some hopes to demonstrating its feasibility through an initial voluntary scheme in France. The EU would be able to build on successes of its existing eco-labels and energy efficiency labels. Those, too, are designed to save to consumers money, in addition to delivering environmental benefits. The experts seem to agree on one point: Money-saving is a necessary prerequisite for sustainability labels to be a success. Guiyu in southern China was long considered the world's biggest electronics recycling site. And it was a highly polluting one at that. More than 5000 small family-run businesses recycled everything from screens to motherboards. Poor workers did much of the recycling — dismantling, sorting and processing the components by hand. This work often took place in homes or by the side of the road, and frequently with little or no protective gear. But the process was very dirty. People burned parts or used toxic chemicals to separate precious metals and other materials from the components. The air was filled with toxins and the ground water became so polluted that it wasn't suitable for drinking. In 2013, the provincial government stepped in. It built a large industrial park on the city's outskirts. If recyclers wanted to stay in business, they had to move to the facility, which was equipped with modern air and water filtration systems to protect the environment. By 2015, the facility was open for business. Having to rent space there cut into the profit margins of smaller companies. Some went bust, but the upside was that air quality improved dramatically. The streets are cleaner too, say residents. This year, China decided it no longer wanted to be the world's dumping ground and banned imports of 24 kinds of waste. As a result, there are no more discarded and broken electronics arriving in Guiyu from Europe or the United States. Well, not officially. For years, China neglected local waste because so much was flowing in from abroad. It arrived better sorted than domestic trash and was more economical to process. Even now, some recyclers are turning to more lucrative illegally imported electronic waste. But now Beijing plans to invest billions in household waste treatment over the next few years to deal with its domestic trash problem. According to local media reports, Chinese authorities are trying to encourage people to sort their trash properly at home. Author: Harald Franzen
