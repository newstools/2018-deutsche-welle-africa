Hulot, a former environmental activist who runs his own ecological foundation, is the second minister in French President Emmanuel Macron's government to be facing sexual harassment allegations. At the end of January, French prosecutors reopened an investigation into allegations of rape filed by an ex-call girl against Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin. ng/rc (AFP, AP)
