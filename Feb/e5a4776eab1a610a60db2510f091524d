Russia's unilateral declaration this week to begin five-hour pauses in the fighting in Syria's eastern Ghouta has been labeled "cynical, callous, and in flagrant defiance of demands" for at least a 30-day ceasefire. The US ambassador for economic and social affairs at the United Nations, Kelley Currie, told a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday that "Russia, Iran and the Assad regime are not even trying to hide their intentions," to urge civilians to leave the area on a false premise so that they can attack anyone left in the last rebel-controlled area near the capital, Damascus.

Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia meanwhile accused Syrian rebels of failing to ensure a temporary halt in the violence. The West doesn't understand Defending Moscow's use of short pauses rather than a 30-day ceasefire adopted by the Security Council on Saturday, Nebenzia said the criticism amounted to a failure to understand realities on the ground or a deliberate exploitation of human tragedy." He said Russia was doing "everything possible" to implement the truce. Both Moscow and Damascus say they are battling terrorist groups operating in and around the enclave that are excluded from the truce. More than 500 people have been killed so far in one of the most ferocious attacks on eastern Ghouta near Damascus since the conflict began in 2011. President Bashar Assad's forces continued their assault on eastern Ghouta despite a UN resolution demanding a 30-day ceasefire, as well as a five-hour daily "pause" ordered by President Vladimir Putin, the Syrian regime's main ally. Referring to the Syrian regime's latest assault, which began on February 19, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres demanded "this hell on earth" be stopped immediately. Eastern Ghouta is one of the last rebel strongholds and is home to about 400,000 people, most of whom have been unable to flee. Damascus wants to gain territory, with the help of Russia, to secure its interests during peace talks. According to activists and doctors in the region, several people have suffered symptoms consistent with those triggered by a chlorine gas attack and had to be treated in hospital. French President Emmanuel Macron has warned the Syrian regime that the use of chemical weapons will result in French retaliation, but the Syrian government claims it has never used this kind of munition. A man and child look at the remains of a missile in the besieged settlement of Douma, the largest in eastern Ghouta. More than 300,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in 2011, when the government cracked down on protesters who were calling for the release of political prisoners and for President Bashar Assad to step down. Activists say people in Douma have little food or water. Marten Mylius, the emergency relief coordinator for CARE in the Middle East, told DW that "after the tunnels were destroyed and the crossings closed, the price of basic foods skyrocketed. One kilo of rice now costs $4.50 (€3.66). A lot of people cannot afford that anymore. In other words, we are witnessing a rapid spread of malnutrition." Aid access to eastern Ghouta is difficult because there is no direct route from neighboring countries. "In Idlib, for example...you can get in directly from the Turkish border. You can wait with supplies at the border and then bring in the convoy. It is much more difficult in eastern Ghouta because we have to negotiate with the Syrian regime and are at the mercy of its decisions," Mylius told DW. The UN Security Council unanimously demanded a 30-day ceasefire in Syria "without delay" on February 24. Drafted by Kuwait and Sweden, the resolution proposed a 30-day pause in fighting across the country to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered and people in need of emergency medical assistance to be evacuated. Russia insisted that the text not apply to the "Islamic State" group or al-Qaida. Author: Nicole Goebel Despite Russia beginning the first of several five-hour pauses on Tuesday, aid agencies were unable to deliver humanitarian aid and evacuate the critically ill and wounded, while civilians shunned Russia's offer of a safe passage out of the enclave. Not one of the battered region's 400,000 residents left to board buses provided by the regime on Wednesday, with many armed groups inside the territory insisting that any evacuations be conducted under UN supervision. UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told the Security Council that the 30-day ceasefire deal agreed at the weekend must go into force to allow aid to enter. Trucks loaded with supplies have been poised to go to 10 locations, but there has been no access for humanitarian convoys, nor authorization by the regime to go into the besieged areas, he said. Civilians in peril Lowcock warned that if the truce was not implemented soon, "we will soon see even more people dying from starvation and disease than from the bombing and the shelling."

The onslaught has been one of the fiercest of Syria's civil war, now entering its eighth year. Moscow's humanitarian pause echoes a similar tactic employed by Russia and the Syrian regime as they looked to force rebels out of Syria's second-largest city, Aleppo, during a ferocious 2016 battle. The hiatus is envisaged to run daily for five hours beginning at 9 a.m. local time (0700 UTC). The first day of the truce on Tuesday quickly collapsed when bombing and shelling resumed after a short lull, while Wednesday's cessation of violence was sandwiched by air raids which killed three people, the Observatory said. mm/rc (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
