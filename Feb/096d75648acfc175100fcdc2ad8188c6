Anthropologists are still divided over the origins of kissing. A commonly held belief is that it grew out of kiss feeding. That's the practice of one individual chewing food and feeding it to another who is incapable of breaking it down themselves. AnimalsÂ usually do this mouth to mouth.

But there are certainly many animals that display behavior that could be mistaken for kissing. Check out our gallery to find out more.
