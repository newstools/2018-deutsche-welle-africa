"People are being talked to, people are being calmed down, but emotions can't be taken away from them." A police spokesman told news weekly Focus: "We expect it was a tragic accident." Invisible killer: Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced when materials burn without sufficient oxygen. Common sources are defective heating systems or power generators. When inhaled, it blocks the transport of oxygen through the bloodstream and can lead to death. Multiple cases: Several hundred people die each year in Germany from carbon monoxide poisoning often caused by charcoal grills, heating, or gasoline powered appliances. In 2017 a man was found guilty of negligent killing after six teenagers, including his son and daughter, were killed by carbon monoxide from a gasoline generator in his allotment shed in the Bavarian town of Arnstein. Install a detector: Smoke detectors are mandatory throughout Germany but carbon monoxide detectors are not. Nonetheless they can be purchased and installed relatively cheaply.
