She entered the French parliament in 2012 at the age of 22, making her the youngest elected MP since the French revolution. The former lawmaker is considered to have an even more hardline stance than her aunt on themes such as Islam and immigration. She is against state-funded abortion and remains a favorite among many grassroots FN voters. Even Trump's former strategist Steve Bannon once hailed her as a rising star. However, back in May, she announced her exit from politics for "personal and political reasons" following her aunt's defeat in the French presidential election to Emmanuel Macron. Tensions and political disagreements between the two family members were widely reported in the French press and were thought to have pushed her to quit politics.

The anti-Europe, anti-immigration party is currently struggling. Marine Le Pen has pushed to sanitize the party from the image of her father Jean-Marie, who has several convictions for racism and anti-Semitism.

The FN leader admitted this week she would be prepared to step aside if a better candidate were to emerge in the run-up to the 2022 election. Le Pen is slated to hold a party congress next month, where she is expected to define the FN's position ahead of the upcoming European elections. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
