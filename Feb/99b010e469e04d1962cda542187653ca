Amid objections from the United States, and especially Israel, Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday signed a controversial Holocaust bill into law. The legislation allows the government to jail anyone who, "publicly and against the facts," suggests Polish involvement in Nazi war crimes committed during World War II. Duda claimed that the law will prevent the wrongful accusation of Poles and Poland of any such involvement.

Duda said that the bill will be reviewed by a top Polish court to assess the possibility of adding amendments in the future. He also emphasized that he had been made cognizant of concerns that the law could potentially block artistic or historical works on the Holocaust during a trip to Israel last year.

The law has sparked aggressive disputes within Poland as well as abroad. Israel has repeatedly expressed outrage, claiming that it will stifle Holocaust discussion and allow for the whitewashing of crimes such as the denunciation and killing of Jews by Poles. After having his upcoming trip to Warsaw cancelled by the Polish government on Monday due to his strong criticism of the law, Israel's hard-right education minister, Naftali Bennet, said he was "honored." Relations between the two countries have been greatly strained by the Polish government's decision to push forward with the legislation. Both sides have, nevertheless, said they are committed to continuing dialogue.

Jewish groups in the United States have accused the Polish government of "engaging in denial."

This weekend, Beate Mazurek, a spokesperson for Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS), quoted a tweet by a Catholic priest exclaiming that criticism of the law by Israel's ambassador to Poland, "make it hard for me to look at Jews with sympathy and kindness." On Monday, a group of far-right protesters at Poland's presidential palace carried a large banner reading: "Take off your yarmulke. Sign the bill." The bill was passed by the Polish parliament before being presented to President Duda. It is unclear whether the PiS controlled Constitutional Tribunal will call for changes. js/rt (AP, Reuters)
