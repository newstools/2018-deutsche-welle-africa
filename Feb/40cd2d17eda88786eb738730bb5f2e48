South African President Jacob Zuma's African National Congress (ANC) party on Tuesday said it has decided to remove him from office, but said no deadline had been set for the embattled leader to step down. Local reports said the party's National Executive Committee, which met for 13 hours from Monday into Tuesday at a hotel outside the capital, Pretoria, to discuss Zuma's future, suggest officials have given him 48 hours to resign. ANC General Secretary Ace Magashule told reporters on Tuesday that Zuma had agreed to step down but wanted to serve a notice period of 3 to 6 months. Magashule said the party could not agree on Zuma's request for an extended stay. Magashule said he had met Zuma personally to pass on the decision. "We haven't given him any deadline to respond ... the organization expects him to go," he said.
