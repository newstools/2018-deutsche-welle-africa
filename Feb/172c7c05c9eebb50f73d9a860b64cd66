And yet that's what many in the country have been doing — often under duress and with little or no compensation, they say. The land being sold off to multinational corporations is being converted into huge palm oil and cocoa plantations as well as mass deforestation.  Proética, the Peruvian chapter of Transparency International, is fighting corruption in the business by examining the legitimacy of local land deals.
