The United Nations in Syria on Tuesday called for a one-month ceasefire in the country to allow the delivery of desperately needed supplies and medical care to civilians caught up in fighting. Jan Egeland, the head of a UN task force on humanitarian aid in Syria, said 7,878 people were displaced per day in 2017 (equating to around 240,000 per month) especially in areas such as Deir el-Zour, Raqqa, Aleppo, and rural Damascus.

So far, 380 families have managed to reach surrounding neighborhoods but thousands of people remain displaced. - Hasaka: An agreement was reached to allow some UN partners to continue their work in Hasaka but after a month most humanitarian assistance came to a close. The agreement is only for a period of two months and covers a limited number of partners. A ceasefire for Hasaka was agreed upon between the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia and the Syrian army in August 2016. - Raqqa: The UN said the "devastation is unparalleled and conditions remain unsafe," in the former "Islamic State" (IS) stronghold, which was liberated in October 2017. Many civilians are killed and injured by unexploded ordinance while attempting to return home. "Services are absent" and access for aid workers is almost impossible due to unsafe conditions. - Idlib: Military operations in what is one of the last rebel-held stronghold have resulted in increased casualties and the movement of civilians — about 1.2 million out of 2.4 million civilians have been internally displaced. "With the high concentration of displaced people, the Governorate may not be able to withstand the consequences of renewed fighting," the UN said. The towns of Foah and Kafraya in Idlib continue to be besieged by non-State armed groups. - Rukban: Civilians in Rukban camp,  a no-man's land between the Syrian and Jordanian border, are inaccessible to the UN team in Syria. The last aid supply of food and other items was from across the border in early January. - Eastern Ghouta: "Humanitarian needs are increasing and life-saving aid is urgently required," in the rebel-stronghold the UN said, but people in need have not been reached with inter-agency assistance since late November 2017. "Fighting and retaliatory shelling from all parties is impacting civilians in this region and Damascus causing scores of deaths and injuries," the statement said. - In IS-held areas, in Yarmouk Camp and other locations in Syria, civilians continue to be held captive, subjected to violence and coercion.
