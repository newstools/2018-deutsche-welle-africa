High-speed trains have epitomized China's ascent of the technology value chain over the past couple of decades. Today, the country dominates the global railway market, particularly for high-speed train systems. It currently boasts over 20,000 kilometers (12,500 miles) of high-speed rail tracks, more than the rest of the world combined. China has also been aggressively marketing its high-speed rail expertise and busily exporting its trains to countries in Asia, Europe and even North America over the past several years. As part of Beijing's "high-speed rail diplomacy," Chinese firms have sold technology to Thailand, Hungary, Romania and Serbia, among other places. The Chinese government also pushed for the merger of the nation's two railway firms, resulting in the creation in 2015 of the rolling-stock behemoth CRRC, the world's biggest rail conglomerate in terms of sales with an annual revenue of around €30 billion ($35.2 billion). The emergence of CRRC meant intensified competition in a sector that had hitherto been the domain of a limited number of companies from Europe, Japan and North America. To combat CRRC, German industrial giant Siemens and its French rival Alstom decided last year to merge their railway operations. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

A major high-speed train project connecting Malaysia and Singapore, however, may demonstrate who has the upper hand in the sector. To bid for the project, Alstom and Siemens - together with a couple of other European firms - have formed a powerful consortium and partnered with the Malaysian engineering firm George Kent. "This partnership shall result in a powerful team combining European technology and project experience with the best local experience," AFP news agency reported quoting a joint statement filed with the Malaysian stock exchange. The 350-kilometer (217-mile) link that will connect Singapore with the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur is targeted to be completed by 2026. Bids must be submitted by the middle of this year and the contract is expected to be awarded by year-end. The Europeans hope that by forming a consortium and joining forces with a local entity they will be able to outmaneuver Asian competitors from China and Japan. "While much of the talk until now revolved around the fact that competition would mostly be about China vs. Japan, this new consortium really changes the situation, and creates a competitive triangle for this very big and high-profile contract," said Agatha Kratz, an adviser at Rhodium Group focusing on EU-China relations and China's global FDI and infrastructure diplomacy. At this point of time, however, it is hard to predict who will ultimately manage to secure the contract. Experts like Kratz say it can sometimes be tough for European train makers to find their competitive spot in Asia, particularly in Southeast Asia, where governments have much more intense and long-lasting ties with Japan and China, and their companies.

"But this situation might also represent an opportunity for the European consortium," she pointed out. "It can play the 'neither China nor Japan' card, by presenting itself as a non-politicized choice and spare the regional governments the trouble of having to pick between the region's two prominent players." Money matters Still, huge high-speed train projects require commensurately significant government support, and one of the major weaknesses of the European side might be their inability, compared to Japan or China, to bring with them large financing for the projects. Beijing regards the sector as strategically important, and China's state-run railway firms receive strong support in the form of low-cost credit for any projects they target. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pushing hard to sell his country's famed Shinkansen bullet trains, by dangling billions of dollars in soft loans to make them an attractive proposition to potential customers. Even though financing poses a challenge for European companies, Kratz said, their chances are almost equal to that of their competitors when it comes to projects like the Malaysia-Singapore one, which are based on an open and competitive tender.

"China's relatively short history of high-speed rail usage means it is still unclear how resistant CRRC trains are to usual wear and usage, and how much maintenance they might require over their lifetime," noted Kratz, stressing that maintenance can have a high cost, which can upset the overall lower CRRC sale price tag. "Furthermore, CRRC's international quality image is still somewhere behind Alstom's or Siemens', who both benefit from an impeccable reputation and track record." Regardless of who ultimately wins the Malaysia-Singapore project, it is clear that demand for high-speed trains in Asia is on the rise as the region modernizes its railway infrastructure. That is likely to present an array of opportunities for European manufacturers, if they are able to better understand and adjust to the technological and financing needs of their customers. Every German knows the ICE. That's according to ICE operator Deutsche Bahn, which claims the ICE brand has a 100 percent recognition rate. The high-speed train is Deutsche Bahn's flagship, although it accounts for only 8 to 10 percent of the railway's total revenues. A new ICE 4, at its unveiling in Berlin in December 2015, as an ICE 3 races past. The new model is expected to run within test operations starting in autumn this year, and have its place on the normal train timetable in 2017. The ICE 4 is close to 350 meters (382 yards) long and seats 830 passengers. The Trans Europ Express was the standard for fast trains which ran from 1957 to 1987 across what was then the European Economic Community (EWG) - a precursor to the European Union. These trains only had first-class wagons. The photo features the legendary TEE train, also called the "Rheingold". A glimpse into the interiors of the TEE "Rheingold" - a luxury train of the 1960s, where a carriage with a bar was a prominent feature. Today's train enthusiasts can still enjoy the atmosphere here - travel agencies offer special tours with the TEE, and with them a taste of past glitz and glamor. In the 1930s, the German Reichsbahn had a strong preference for diesel rail cars. Fast train connections were in a race with private cars and airplanes for high-speed dominance. In 1933, "flying trains" were introduced, cutting down significantly on travel time. The first high-speed rail network was established - the foundation of today's ICE network. As early as 1903, the first tests in the high-speed transport sector were being carried out by a well-known research association for electric high speed rail networks. A three-phase express rail car reached peak speeds of 210 km/h on a test rail in Berlin. But it was only after the first world war that high-speed rail cars were further developed. The fastest of all trains based on conventional rail technology is France's TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse). It's been around since 1981. The newest version, the AGV, reached a speed of 574 km/h (356 mph) in 2007, compared to its normal operating speed of 320 km/h. TGV trains can be found in Germany, Belgium, the UK, Switzerland, and Italy. The Velaro train model, also produced by ICE maker Siemens - doesn't have locomotive engines anymore, but motor units. The fastest Velaro train runs regularly in China - the Harmony CHR 380A. During a test run in 2010, the train managed a speed of 486 km/h. Today, it runs between Beijing and Shanghai at an operating speed of 380 km/h. Even before the French, Japanese engineers developed a high speed train - the Shinkansen. An early model of this train ran at speeds of 210 km/h during the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The newest model, like the one pictured here, runs at a maximum speed of 320 km/h. The Hyperloop is a conceptual high-speed transport system originally put forward by Tesla founder Elon Musk.It incorporates reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors, allowing for speeds of more than 1,200 km/h.
