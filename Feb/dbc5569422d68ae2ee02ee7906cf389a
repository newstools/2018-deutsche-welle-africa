Martin Selmayr, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's chief of staff, will be the Commission's next secretary-general, Juncker said on Wednesday. Selmayr, an ardently pro-EU German, has been called the "the Rasputin of Brussels" for his behind-the-scenes influence in European Union politics. Who is Martin Selmayr?

Selmayr's promotion out of Juncker's office and into the Commission's top civil service post could bolster his influence in EU politics for years to come. Fears of German power: Selmayr's appointment could also renew fears among some EU countries that Germany is gaining too much influence in EU institutions. Germany is the largest and richest member state, and it is reportedly interested in appointing a German to the post of European Central Bank (ECB) chief. Günther Oettinger, the EU human resources commissioner, has, however, said Berlin has not always agreed with Selmayr. What happens next: Selmayr is set to take over as secretary-general on March 1 with the retirement of Dutch incumbent Alexander Italianer. Spaniard Clara Martinez will replace Selmayr as Juncker's new chief of staff. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
