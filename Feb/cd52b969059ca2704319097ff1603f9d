The Bundeswehr refueled Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif's plane in Munich in mid-February after local fuel companies refused to do so out of fear they would violate US sanctions against Iran, according to German media reports. The refueling took place while Zarif was attending the Munich Security Conference with other foreign officials and security experts, daily newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and regional public broadcasters NDR and WDR reported on Tuesday.

Iran has claimed its nuclear program is peaceful, but the US and other world powers suspect it could be used to develop nuclear weapons.

Iranian officials rejected those choices and instead requested the conference organizer, Wolfgang Ischinger, who was previously Germany's ambassador to the US, to ask the German government to intervene. The Defense Ministry agreed to take over the refueling a day before Zarif's arrival.

Ischinger was delighted that the solution secured Zarif's attendance at the conference: "Whatever you think of the sanctions, they almost ended here with us not being able to talk to each other at a dangerous point in time." According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the Iranians have paid the Bundeswehr for the 17,000-liter fuel bill.
