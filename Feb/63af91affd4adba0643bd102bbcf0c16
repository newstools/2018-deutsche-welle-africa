Henrik met Danish Crown Princess Margrethe at a dinner party in London 1965 where she was studying. They were married in 1967, five years before she was crowned queen. When he wed Margrethe in 1967, he converted to become a Lutheran and changed his name to the more Danish Henrik. Henrik had some difficulties with the Danish royal system which stated that the queen was the monarch. He had hoped be known as "king" and have a more prominent role but that was not to be. It was said he was upset to be ranked third in line after his two sons, In September of 2017, the palace announced that the prince was suffering from dementia. Henrik died peacefully in his sleep late Tuesday at Fredensborg Palace. The Queen and his two sons were by his side. av/aw (AP, AFP, dpa)
