+++ Refresh page for updates, all times in CET +++ Medal Events Day 9 - Men's Giant Slalom (5:45) - Men's Biathlon 15km Mass Start (12:15) - Men's Cross-Country 4x10km Relay (7:15) - Men's Ski Slopestyle (6:11) - Men's Aerials (12:52) - Women's 500m short-track speed skating (12:56) 02:30 - Some stunning scores in the Slopestyle. James Woods' 90.20 is now only good enough for third after sensational runs from American Nick Goepper (92.80) then Switzerland's Andri Ragettli (95.00) raise the bar even higher. This is a high class line up. 02:25: - Reigning World Champion Marcel Hirscher, of Austria, has already picked up gold in the combined in Pyeongchang and looks in the mood for another as he flies down the Giant Slalom course to set a new time to beat of 1:08:27. 02:15 - The delayed Giant Slalom is underway. One skier down, 109 to go. 02:07 - A brilliant run from Great Britain's James Woods sees him take the lead with a score of 90.20. It's amazing how mundane these guys make these ridiculous feats of physicality look. Elsewhere, the Men's Giant Slalom has been delayed, but only until 02:15. 02:03 - And we're off in the Slopestyle where 30 skiers get two runs to set their best score. Then 12 of the 30 make it to the final. The first two skiers, McRae Williams of the USA started us off with a 81.60. 01:50: - The Men's Ski Slopestyle is also set to begin in 10 minutes. That'll have two qualification runs before three final runs. All you maths experts out there will have already figured out that's a total of five runs and they come over a period of about four hours. 01:45 - As has been the case for the last few days, it's curling that starts us off. Norway vs. Denmark, USA vs. Japan and Switzerland vs. Canada have all just got under way. The men's Giant Slalom is the next cab off the rank, the first run starts at 02:00. But it won't be quick, there are 110 athletes. Hope you're ready for a late night/early morning... 01:30 - Hello again and welcome back to day 9 of our Winter Olympics coverage. Not so much in the way of medals today but plenty to keep an eye on, including the Men's Ski Slopestyle medal race, Women's 500m Speed Skating and Men's Super-G. There was a huge shock in the Women's Super-G on day 8 and a Japanese hero showered with toy bears. You can catch up with everything that happened yesterday in our roundup.
