The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Tuesday appealed for $17 million (€13.8 million) to support the rebuilding of health facilities for children in Iraq, following three years of violence that have "devastated health facilities." In a statement, UNICEF said, "As many as 750,000 children in [the major northern city of] Mosul and surrounding areas are struggling to access basic health services."
