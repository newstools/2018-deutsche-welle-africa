Rabobank's lawyer James Cavoli declined to speak to the press, and the company has yet to release a statement on the plea deal. What's significant: The settlement is among the largest in history for laundering Mexican drug money, although it's still significantly less than a 2012 fine paid by HSBC, which was $1.9 billion, for money laundering. In 2010, Wachovia Bank paid $160 million for similar crimes. What happens next: Rabobank must pay $369 million for the money it laundered, $50 million of which is a fine from the Treasury Department.
