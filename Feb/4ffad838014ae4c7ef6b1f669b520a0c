Airbus said in its own statement that it had accepted the fine and that the German investigation "has been terminated." No evidence of bribery, but suspect funds Prosecutors in Munich noted in their statement that the investigation did not find evidence of bribery. However, Airbus was unable to account for over 100 million euros in payments made to two shell companies in Great Britain. "The funds, which bypassed internal controls and were largely without provable return, were used for unclear purposes," the statement said. "It cannot be determined based on the cash flows, which purposes the payments ultimately served." German authorities, therefore, concluded that Airbus failed in its supervisory duty by allowing its former management to make the payments.
