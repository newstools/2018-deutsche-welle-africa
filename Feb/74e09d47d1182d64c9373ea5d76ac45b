Forty-eight hours after Germany's big centrist parties finally hammered out their long coalition contract, several German politicians and news outlets have noticed that the names on the list of potential cabinet members included only one from the former East Germany (GDR): Angela Merkel (and even she was not actually born there). There were sharp voices of concern, especially from eastern Germans in junior coalition partners the Social Democratic Party (SPD). "An East German must be represented in the cabinet," demanded Manuela Schwesig (born in Frankfurt an der Oder on the Polish border). The former SPD family minister was born and raised in the GDR and is now state premier of Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania, a federal state formerly in East Germany. The Saxony Integration Minister Petra Köpping was even more forthright, telling Der Spiegel, "I am horrified that there will be no East German in the cabinet." The Left party's charismatic veteran Gregor Gysi, an East Berliner whose political career began under the communist regime, compared the cabinet to Germany's top courts (where East Germans are also under-represented). "Maybe someone will realize at some point that the East does belong to Germany after all," he told Der Spiegel.

All communication between East and West was cut off. In the following weeks the concrete wall began to rise, as can be seen in the above photo taken in Zimmerstrasse in the Kreuzberg neighborhood. Barbed wire crowned the wall to prevent people from climbing over the top. The division of Berlin also split the world into East and West. The "Iron Curtain" had finally been drawn closed. Spouses, relatives, friends were brutally torn apart from one another. The communists' name for the wall, the "anti-fascist protection barrier," was a misnomer, however, since the barrier's true purpose was not to keep intruders out but to prevent those in the East from fleeing. A good year after the construction of the Berlin Wall, 18-year-old Peter Fechter tried to climb over it. After reaching the top, GDR soldiers shot him. He fell down on the East Berlin side, where he lay for nearly an hour begging for help in the "death strip." Border patrols eventually picked up the wounded man, who died later in the afternoon. The world was horrified. US President John F. Kennedy visited Berlin on June 26, 1963, sweeping his gaze across the Wall and the death strip. During his speech, he made the legendary statement: "Ich bin ein Berliner." He stressed that the US would not allow West Berlin to fall in the hands of the Soviet Union. Between the Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer Platz, a no-man's-land with various barriers evolved which would define the appearance of the border area during the first decade of the Wall. It was a maze of fencing, barbed wire, heavy-duty vehicles and wooden watchtowers. The East, with its death strip, but also West Berlin were marked by the Wall, particularly the city districts directly adjacent to the border sectors. In the shadows of the Wall, run-down, abandoned areas and open stretches of land developed and became makeshift parking lots, trash dumps or wild gardens. Children would play there, and artists and activists would use the grounds for activities. Beginning in 1975, the Wall became much more massive, with the so-called "Grenzmauer" (Border Wall) measuring 3.6 meters (11.8 feet) in height. Here, a group of builders fills in the cracks between the newly installed concrete segments while a crane manages the round elements atop the wall. Border patrols monitor the construction, while a US military policeman watches the spectacle from the West. The white-washed side of the Wall marks the beginning of the border strip from the East, while St. Thomas Church in the background is located in the West. But surveillance by the Stasi, border patrols and police began far in front of the Wall. A permission slip was required to enter the area. US President Ronald Reagan visited Berlin in June 1987, giving a speech in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the West Berlin side with the famous words: "Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Tear down this wall!" Some 40,000 people cheered. Over a year before, then-Soviet leader Gorbachev had initiated his policies of "glasnost" (openness) and "perestroika" (restructuring). It was ultimately those who were locked in whose peaceful struggle for freedom eventually paid off. November 9, 1989 was a day that went down in history: the fall of the Berlin Wall. At least 101 people lost their lives at the Wall trying to escape the GDR between 1961 and 1989. But not a single drop of blood was shed when it finally opened up. Chris Gueffroy, aged 20, was the last refugee to be shot at the Berlin Wall, nine months before it fell. By 1990 "Wall woodpeckers" had done their work, opening up the Wall bit by bit, with border patrols now letting families pass through. In June 1990, work got underway to tear down the various elements of the Wall and the accompanying barrier constructions. Remnants of the Wall were broken down and even shredded, and then used for building city streets. By 2014 very little of the Berlin Wall remained in its original location, and few people knew where it once stood. Maybe that's why the 2014 installation entitled "Lichtgrenze" (Light Border) was so popular. The temporary project by sibling artists Christopher and Marc Bauder featured 6,880 light "balloons" marking a 15.3-kilometer-long (9.5 miles) path where part of the Wall once stood. The "East Side Gallery" is at 1,316 meters (4,318 feet) the longest stretch of the Berlin Wall remaining. After the Wall opened up, 118 artists from 21 countries painted it in spring 1990. It draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Once it becomes part of the Stiftung Berliner Mauer (Berlin Wall Foundation) as planned, there will also be an information center. Many of the photos in this gallery are also being shown in a special exhibition presented by the Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer (Berlin Wall Memorial). The show runs from February 6 to August 15, 2018 at the visitor center in the city's Bernauer Street. Many of the photos have never been shown before, and there is one for each year between 1961 and 2018: Berlin — with and without the Wall. Author: Klaus Krämer (ls) Failed nation-building Members of Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) also expressed concern, while the Left party leader Katja Kipping reiterated her party's call for an East Germany Ministry, and said the grand coalition contract agreed on Wednesday did nothing for people living in the former East. "There is no plan for salaries in the former East to be equal to those in the West, no end to discrimination, no justice in the GDR pensions," she told news agency AFP. "It's still a debate in Germany because the expectation that the process of nation-building — which hasn't yet really finished in other countries, like Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia — would be finished in Germany much sooner, and that was a mistake," said Gero Neugebauer, a Berlin-based political scientist who spent his childhood in East Germany before moving to the West in 1957.

"But in eastern Germany people don't see themselves as being treated equally." That sense of inequality wasreiterated last November by Thomas Krüger, head of Germany's Federal Agency for Civic Education (bpb), said, "The domination of West Germans in the elite is still felt as cultural colonialism." A 2016 study commissioned by public broadcaster MDR found that there were fewer leaders of East German origin in the five former East German state governments in 2016 than there had been in 2004 — with the proportion sinking from 75 percent to 70 percent.

"If Ms Schwesig wants more East Germans she needs to address her party, not the public," said Neugebauer. Read more: How artists in East Germany fight rise of far-right Eastern German CDU Bundestag member Marco Wanderwitz admitted to Der Spiegel that there was a dearth in talent. "The best horse in our stable was [Interior Minister] Thomas de Maiziere — at the moment we don't have anything to offer at that level," he said. The draft of the coalition contract agreed on Wednesday declares that "we recognize the special challenges in East Germany as a task for the whole of Germany," and CDU Saxony state premier Michael Kretschmer claimed that "no coalition contract that I can remember has accommodated East German interests more than this one." But Neugebauer doubts whether certain measures in the contract that might benefit people in the East more — such as programs to help the long-term unemployed back to work - will be perceived as such by the wider public.
