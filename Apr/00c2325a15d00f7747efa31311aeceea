One person was killed and four firefighters received minor injuries in a fire on the 50th floor of Trump Tower in New York on Saturday. The victim died at hospital and has not yet been identified, according to news agency Reuters. The man who died was a resident of the 50th floor and was taken to hospital in critical condition, department spokeswoman Angelica Conroy told CNN. Smoke was seen rising from 50th floor of the 58-story skyscraper, headquarters of The Trump Organization in Midtown Manhattan, New York, at around 6:00 pm (2200 UTC). "This was a very difficult fire. As you can imagine, the apartment is quite large, we are 50 stories up. The rest of the building had a considerable amount of smoke," the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) said. The blaze was contained after over 100 firefighters made their way into the building, closing off surrounding buildings and streets. The cause of the fire was not immediately apparent. Trump later tweeted that the blaze had been extinguished. "Fire at Trump Tower is out. Very confined (well built building). Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU!" he wrote on Twitter. Three people suffered non-life-threatening injuries in January when a small fire broke out in apparatus on top of the skyscraper. jbh/es (AFP, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
