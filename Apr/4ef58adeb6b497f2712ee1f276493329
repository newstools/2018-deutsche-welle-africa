At least nine Israeli teenagers died Thursday after being swept away in a sudden flood in the Negev desert. Another member of the group of 25 is still missing. The students, aged 17 and 18, were hiking along a usually dry riverbed of Nahal Tzafit as a part of pre-army training course. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the trekkers were "caught off guard" by the flood and some of them were "washed away." "Police & Emergency teams working together after flash floods struck the south of Israel near the Dead Sea where students were on a day trip," he wrote on Twitter.
