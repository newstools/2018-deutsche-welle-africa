A court in Hamburg ruled in favor of Alice Weidel, a senior politician of the far-right AfD party, who sued Facebook over an insulting comment published by a user on their platform. The comment clearly violated the politician's rights, the judge said on Friday. In September, a user identified as Sanda G. left a German-language comment on Weidel under a Facebook post linking to a Huffington Post article. The article was reporting on an alleged statement by Weidel — herself a lesbian — against gay marriage in Germany.

According to Weidel's lawyer Joachim Steinhöfel, Facebook refused to remove the comment even after other users reported it. It was only hidden from view when Weidel herself contacted the platform in January. Limits of national court? However, Facebook only blocked the comment for users with a German IP address. Users could bypass the restriction by using a VPN tunnel that allows a computer in Germany to access the content from a server in a different country. The Hamburg court confirmed the comment was still visible via a VPN-tunnel. The court also said it would decide on Monday whether or not to order an injunction against Facebook that would force it to close this gap.

Munz also pointed out ramifications for freedom of speech if Facebook is compelled to enforce a decision taken by a national court on an international level. "Facebook is not a superjudge," he said.
