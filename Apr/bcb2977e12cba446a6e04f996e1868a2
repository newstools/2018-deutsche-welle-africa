The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) on Thursday said it agreed with Britain's conclusions about the type of poison that was used in an attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Blood samples "confirm the findings of the United Kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical," according to a summary of the Hague-based group's report released in London.

The British government previously identified the military-grade nerve agent as Novichok in its own tests and had requested the OPCW carry out an independent investigation. The chemical watchdog did not actually name the chemical in its declassified summary, nor did it assign blame for the March 4 attack on Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the southern town of Salisbury. It did say, however, that "the toxic chemical was of high purity," and that the substance had been named in the full classified report.

Russia strongly denies it was involved and insists it has destroyed all of its chemical weapons. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the OPCW's findings prove Britain's suspicions. "This is based on testing in four independent, highly reputable laboratories around the world. All returned the same conclusive results," he said. "There can be no doubt what was used and there remains no alternative explanation about who was responsible — only Russia has the means, motive and record."

His daughter was visiting from Russia when they were poisoned. British police said the toxin was placed on the doorknob of his home. Yulia, 33, was discharged from hospital earlier this week, while her father is still receiving treatment and is said to be improving rapidly. The results of the laboratory tests will be discussed at an emergency OPCW session next Wednesday. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
