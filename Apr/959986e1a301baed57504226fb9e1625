US President Donald Trump's doctor, Ronny Jackson, withdrew from his bid to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs office on Thursday, following prolonged controversy over alleged alcohol abuse and over-prescription of drugs. Veterans groups wield considerable political clout in the US and have been dismayed by continued disarray at the department, despite Trump's campaign promises to improve veterans care.

McMaster with John Bolton as his national security adviser. A respected general, McMaster said he would retire from the US Army and public service. McMaster's departure was not a complete surprise as he and Trump are reported to have had conflicting views on a number of US policies. A former Exxon executive, Tillerson had served as secretary of state for a little over a year. Donald Trump ousted Tillerson in order to form a "new team" ahead of talks with North Korea, adding that he and Tillerson "disagreed on things." The relationship between them is said to have deteriorated after Tillerson reportedly called Trump a "moron" in October 2017. A Goldman Sachs veteran, Gary Cohn served as Donald Trump's top economic adviser at the head of the National Economic Council. He helped push through controversial tax reforms in 2017. However, Cohn stepped down in March 2018 after failing to persuade Trump to give up his idea of imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Hope Hicks resigned from her post as the White House Communications Director in late February 2018. A day before resigning, she testified before US lawmakers on Russian interference. She admitted to telling "white lies" for Donald Trump, but not related to Russia. The White House insisted her resignation was not linked to the testimony. The 29-year-old was among Trump's closest aides. The White House staff secretary handed in his resignation after his ex-wives accused him of domestic abuse. Despite resigning, Rob Porter denied the allegations as "simply false." Trump initially defended Porter, and the US media questioned if and how Porter passed his background check for the job. Recently, reports surfaced of a romance between Porter and Trump's longtime aide Hope Hicks. He played a key role in getting Donald Trump into the White House, but even chief strategist Stephen Bannon was ousted within a year. Bannon was a champion of economic nationalism and Trump's "America First" strategy. After the fallout of white supremacist violence in Charlottesville mid-Aigust, Bannon agreed to leave the administration. The 53-year-old former hedge fund investor nicknamed the "Mooch" was communications director for just 10 days. The colorful New Yorker filled a dream role that had been vacant for months, but was forced out on the same day that straight-shooting former Marine Corps general John Kelly became chief of staff. Trump was displeased with his infamous expletive-laden rant against other senior staff. Walter Shaub, the former director of the Office of Government Ethics, resigned in July 2017 after clashing with the White House over Trump's complicated financial holdings. Shaub reportedly called Trump's administration a "laughing stock." Reince Priebus, the former White House chief-of-staff, was forced out just six months into his tenure after a public feud with Anthony Scaramucci, the White House communications director. Priebus was reportedly among those West Wing staffers who opposed the hire of Scaramucci. Sean Spicer, who had a fraught relationship with the president and the press, resigned after telling Trump he vehemently disagreed with the selection of Anthony Scaramucci as White House communications director. Michael Dubke, the former White House communications director, was asked to leave in May 2017 over what was perceived as his poor handling of the allegations involving Russian involvement in the US election. US President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey - allegedly over how he handled the Clinton emails investigation. Critics, however, believe the FBI's probe into Trump's campaign ties with Russia was the real reason. Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned in February 2017 after revelations that he had discussed US sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the US before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. 'False accusations' Jackson said in a statement: "The allegations against me are completely false and fabricated ... Unfortunately, because of how Washington works, these false allegations have become a distraction for this president and the important issue we must be addressing — how we give the best care to our nation’s heroes." Trump called into "Fox & Friends" morning show after the announcement and said: "These are all false accusations. They're trying to destroy a man." He said Jon Tester, the Democrat who led the push against Jackson, "has a big price to pay." Marc Short, the White House legislative director also lashed at Tester, saying "it's quite unusual for a United States senator to take allegations that have not been fully investigated, but to flaunt them to the national public to suggest he's the 'candyman' I think is outrageous." National commander of The American Legion, the nation's largest veterans organization, said the group was "very concerned about the current lack of permanent leadership." The director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America said: "VA's reputation is damaged, staff is demoralized, momentum is stalled and the future is shockingly unclear."

Earlier this month House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan announced he would leave his post at the start of 2019 ahead of congressional elections. Ryan's departure in particular led to Republican concerns about their prospects with US voters in November. Read more: Is Paul Ryan's exit an ominous sign for Trump's Republican Party?

The document alleged Jackson doled out drugs to staffers like the "candy man," prescribed himself medications, got drunk at a Secret Service party then wrecked a government vehicle, and once could not be reached on a work trip to provide medical treatment because he was passed out drunk in a hotel room. Democrats also alleged he knew how to please his bosses but treated his underlings very poorly. What does the department do? The agency oversees healthcare and benefits for America's 20 million military veterans. It has more than 350,000 employees and runs 1,700 facilities seeing 9 million veterans a year. Trump had pledged to overhaul the agency, which has been criticized for the quality of its care and vast red tape. Of particular concern are its shortcomings in psychiatric care for those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Next step: Trump has not revealed who will be his next nominee, but the White House suggested that Jackson would remain in his current post of presidential physician. aw/rt (AP, Reuters, AFP)
