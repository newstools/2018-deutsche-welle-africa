Italy's Foreign Ministry summoned the French ambassador on Saturday after French border patrol guards brought a Nigerian man to a clinic for migrants at a Italian railway station and demanded that staff take a urine sample from him. The humanitarian group Rainbow4Africa, which runs the facility at the Bardonecchia train station between the French city of Grenoble and Turin, in Italy, has denounced what it called a "raid" on Friday night by five armed French border agents. It said the guards, who suspected the migrant of drug trafficking, had intimidated the group's staff.

What happened in Bardonecchia is serious and shows how our so-called friends in Europe have little or no consideration for us," he said in a statement. Bardonecchia Mayor Francesco Avato said the French had no right to enter the facility, which he said the city operates as a "neutral" space to try to persuade migrants not to make the dangerous Alpine crossing into France. After first tackling the Mediterranean, many migrants try to cross the snowy Alps for a new life in France Increased border patrols Italy's Foreign Ministry added that the two countries would address the issue further at a meeting in Turin on April 16. But France said it had a right to intervene, according to a 1990 agreement between the two neighbors.
