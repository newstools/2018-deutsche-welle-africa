The park "is deeply saddened to confirm reports of an attack on our staff today," it said in a statement.

Under threat Monday's attack isn't the first time Virunga National Park staff have come under fire. Earlier this month, a park ranger was killed by armed men while he was guarding a hydroelectric plant construction site.
