2018 saw the warmest recorded April in German history, beating the previous record set in 2009, the National Meteorological Service (DWD) reported on Monday. At a projected 12.4 degrees Celsius (54 F), the average temperature proved 5 degrees Celsius (9 F) higher than the April value from the internationally valid comparison period from 1961-1990 and 4 degrees higher than the figure from 1981-2010.

But in March the sun's rays become more powerful. Despite the risk of sunburn, getting a tan in spring is seen as a healthy way to head into summer. The island of Mainau is the third largest in Lake Constance. The lake has shores in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The island, famous for its floral displays, attracts large numbers of visitors in spring. Mainau is owned by the Lennart Bernadotte Foundation which was set up by a former Prince of Sweden. Beer gardens are welcoming the spring here in Germany. People love to sit outdoors and sip beer, like here in Munich's English Garden. But as well as in Bavaria, you can enjoy a freshly-tapped beer in pub gardens all over Germany. Spring in the northern hemisphere officially begins on March 20. That’s when the days start to grow longer, and spring in western Europe spans March, April and May. But we’ll need some more sunny days before the cherry blossom flourishes in places like Bonn. The plane trees beside the Rhine in Düsseldorf are still waiting to grow new leaves. They are cut back in autumn and boast new foliage in the spring. The locals take advantage of the first warm days of the year to stroll beside the Rhine on the city's promenade. The excursion boats are also ready to start the season. The many young people who have made Dresden their home have given the city a lively and creative flair. On one bank of the River Elbe you'll find the historic city center with its famous baroque ensemble. On the opposite bank you can explore new bars and restaurants and small boutiques. Outdoor life begins here in spring. There are still warm blankets in the outdoor cafés in the German capital. But as the days get warmer, visitors from all over flock to Berlin to enjoy the sunshine and take a stroll along the Unter den Linden boulevard. When the sun comes out, the city beach near Hamburg harbor attracts large numbers of people to the banks of the Elbe river. The sand is brought in by trucks and gives Hamburg an added attraction. The wind doesn’t blow as fiercely on the Baltic as it does on the North Sea. That means the beach chairs are put in place here much earlier than in the North Sea resorts. Many people enjoy the solitude of the Baltic Sea resorts before they get crowded later in the year.

"As a result, at the beginning of the month, temperatures were already predominantly springlike, from the second half even summery." "On average, the month was the overall warmest April for Germany and many federal states since the beginning of continuous weather records in the year 1881."

Average temperatures of below 0 C were registered in 1917, 1929 and 1903. DWD spokesman Gerhard Lux attributed the discrepancy to the effects of climate change. Where are the hot spots? With more than 270 hours of sunshine in parts, southern Germany. Bavaria soaked up most of the country's warmth, with a mean of 12.5 C and, tied with neighboring Baden-Württemberg, 250 hours of sunshine. Berlin was the warmest state overall, with an average temperature of 13.8 C. And the cooler areas? With temperatures averaging just 9.9 C, Schleswig-Holstein was Germany's coldest state. With about 165 hours, the western regions of Emsland, Münsterland, the Ruhr district and the Eifel were among the poorest in terms of sunshine. Dangerously dry: With precipitation of 25 liters per square meter, Bavaria reached just 39 percent of its target and was therefore the precipitation-poorest federal state. Bavaria usually receives 70 liters per square meter in April. The area around Lake Constance on the border with Switzerland, received just 10 liters per square meter. About the DWD: Established in 1952 and now administered by Germany's Transport and Digital Infrastructure Ministry, the DWD is headquartered in Offenbach am Main and gathers statistics on weather and meteorological conditions.
