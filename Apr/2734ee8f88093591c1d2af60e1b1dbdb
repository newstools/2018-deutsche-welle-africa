The cross-party initiative launched its website and social media campaign on Monday under the hashtag #PayMeToo. It is designed to encourage women in the UK to find out if they are being paid as much as their male counterparts and report any inappropriate pay differences. #PayMeToo is backed by eight lawmakers from Britain's main parties, Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats as well as Wales' Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party (SNP). The name borrows from the hashtag #MeToo launched last year in the film industry, which triggered a worldwide discussion on sexual harassment.

"If we are serious about tackling the gender pay gap then we have to do more than publish data — we have to show we're watching what happens next," Creasy told UK daily The Guardian. The website gives advice on how to broach the issue of pay differences with your employer and how to address the pay gap at work. Users can also fill in an anonymous survey, which the initiative says will "inform our work tackling the gender pay gap and fighting for equality in Britain."
