Read more: Protectionism: from Bismarck to Trump Oversupply concerns: The EU, a major exporter of steel and aluminum products, is worried the tariffs would not only limit the imports of its goods into the US, but also lead to its products flooding back into its own markets, causing an oversupply. Global outcry: Last month, Trump unveiled plans for tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, causing a global outcry and worries about a possible trade war.

Unconditional exemption: The EU is insisting on getting a full and unconditional exemption from the tariffs on steel and aluminum.
