Captors of a Catholic Priest in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have demanded $500,000 to release him, the country's local assembly of bishops said on Tuesday. Father Celestin Nagango was abducted from his church in eastern Congo by armed men on Sunday, mere moments after he had delivered an Easter sermon at the parish. Now, the kidnappers are requesting money from the church. "His kidnappers have contacted the St. Paul of Karambi parish to demand US$500,000 (€407,000) in ransom for his release," the National Episcopal Conference of Congo (CENCO) said. Church officials have not yet revealed whether or not a ransom will be paid.

A worrying trend Kidnapping is not uncommon in the DRC, where armed groups often use abductions to extort money from civilians. In July 2016, two Catholic priests, Reverand Charles Kapasa and Reverand Jean Pierre Akilimali, were seized from the Parish of Notre Dame in the Butembo-Beni Diocese, following the kidnapping of three fathers from the Assumptionist Order in October 2012. None of the priests have been seen since. They came from the same area where Reverand Vincent Machozi Karunzu, a priest monitoring human rights abuses, was murdered in March 2016.
