However, if the former leader fails to win the seven candidate race, a run-off vote will be held on April 29. Montenegro's presidency is a ceremonial post, but is expected to become the real seat of power in the country if 56-year-old Djukanovic wins the vote.

The six-time former prime minister said he is running for presidency in order to stabilize Montenegro's pro-Western path amid regional and global instability and "defend" it from Moscow's influence.

Mladen Bojanic is Djukanovic main rival, having been put forward by the leading opposition party, the Democratic Front, which prefers closer ties with Russia and accuses Djukanovic of both nepotism and corruption. Djukanovic has pared back his anti-Russian rhetoric saying he wanted "normal relations with Russia if it is prepared to do the same," but he has also said he wants the country to "remain on its road of development," which would be better achieved through ties with Brussels.

The average salary in Montenegro sits at around €500 ($615) and unemployment is more than 20 percent. The country has also been marred by organized crime, with some 20 people killed by assassinations or car bombs over the last two years. None of the other five candidates are expected to reach percentages in the double digits. Polling stations are expected to close at 8 p.m local time with preliminary results expected soon after. law/jlw (AFP, AP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
