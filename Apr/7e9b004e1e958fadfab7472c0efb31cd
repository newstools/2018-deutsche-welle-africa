Salman Khan was granted bail Saturday while he appeals a five-year prison sentence for killing endangered wildlife two decades ago. Khan spent two nights in prison after a court in Rajasthan state convicted him on Thursday of killing endangered antelope known as blackbucks during a hunting trip in 1998. His lawyers maintain there was no evidence that the blackbucks were shot, arguing that they died of natural causes such as overeating. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
