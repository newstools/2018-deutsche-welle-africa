After jurors left the courtroom, Cosby stood up and shouted in the direction of District Attorney Kevin Steele: "I'm sick of him!" Steele had been arguing for revoking Cosby's bail. Steele said: "Money and power or who you are will not stop us from a criminal investigation or prosecuting a case." Cosby's lawyer, Tom Mesereau, said the "fight is not over" and that his client plans to appeal the verdict. Gloria Allred, a lawyer representing some of the women who have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct and testified during the trial, said: "We are so happy that finally we can say, women are believed."
