Officers had reportedly found two sharpened knives during a raid on the man's apartment in the west of the city. Berlin's mayor thanked the security services on Twitter for ensuring a "peaceful sporting event." "Thank you to the security personnel and Berlin police," wrote Michael Müller. "Your operation ensured that the half-marathon could take place without any incidents and be celebrated as a peaceful sporting event." Link to 2016 Christmas market attack According to Die Welt, the lead suspect who had planned the knife attack reportedly knew Anis Amri, a Tunisian who killed 12 people and injured several dozen more when he drove a truck into a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016. The suspect reportedly wanted to take revenge for Amri's death. Italian police shot and killed the 24-year-old Amri — who had pledged allegiance to the "Islamic State" terrorist group — while he was on the run in Milan. The lead suspect arrested on Sunday was not however a "concrete threat" as security services had been observing him for some time. The other three suspects also had links to Amri, according to Die Welt. Read more: Christmas market terrorist Anis Amri may have been used as 'lure' Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
