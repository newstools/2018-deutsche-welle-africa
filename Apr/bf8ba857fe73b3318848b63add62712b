US actor Verne Troyer, who became a celebrity with his role as Mini-Me, the clone and sidekick of the comic villain Dr. Evil in two of the three "Austin Powers" films, died on Saturday aged 49, his family announced on social media. "It is with great sadness and incredibly heavy hearts to write that Verne passed away today," a statement on the actor's Facebook page said. Although the cause of his death was not given, the statement said, "Depression and suicide are very serious issues. You never know what kind of battle someone is going through inside." Troyer himself had spoken in public of his struggles with alcohol addiction, and his family said on April 3 in another social media statement that he was receiving medical treatment.
