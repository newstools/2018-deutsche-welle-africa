Say ‘Athens’ and everyone thinks of the Acropolis. Say Berlin and it’s the Brandenburg Gate that first pops into your mind. Europe is full of famous architectural landmarks. In our series we present some of them to you.  Now it's your turn. What's your favorite sight? Present it to us! Maybe you visited it on a trip, or maybe it’s in your hometown?    Take part in our prize draw by sending us a photo of yourself in front of an architectural landmark that you particularly like.   To send us the picture, simply visit our webpage and upload it. All submissions will be entered into a prize draw for a 3D puzzle of the Eiffel Tower.    The closing date for entries is Friday, April 27, 2018, 12 noon UTC. All decisions are final. Good luck!
