"Ladies, please get off the ring," a sumo referee said. "Only gentlemen go up." Sumo chief Nobuyoshi Hakkaku said the call for the women to be removed from the ring was inappropriate and apologized late on Wednesday, while thanking the women for their actions. Professional sumo is a man's game, women are not allowed to compete and cannot even enter or touch the ring 'Inappropriate response' In a statement, Hakkaku said the announcement was made by an official who panicked after seeing the women in the ring, but did not mention the age-old tradition. "It was an inappropriate response in a life-threatening situation," Hakkaku said. The mayor, who suffered an acute cerebral hemorrhage, survived and was in a stable condition on Thursday after undergoing emergency surgery, city officials said.
