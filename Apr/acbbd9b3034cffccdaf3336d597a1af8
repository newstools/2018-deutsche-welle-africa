From there the barge will wind its way to the Russian Far East and the Arctic coast off of Chukotka. There, it is expected to go into service in 2019. The idea is for it to power a port town, oil rigs, and a desalination plant. The twin reactors are expected to provide up to 200,000 people with electricity from a Siberian port in Pewek.
