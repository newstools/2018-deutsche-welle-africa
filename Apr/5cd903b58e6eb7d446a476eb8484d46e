The Arab League — minus Syria and Qatar — said after its summit on Sunday that the "criminal" use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime had to be investigated. It further condemned the government of Iran for ignoring the sovereignty of other countries. "We stress our absolute condemnation of the use of chemical weapons against the sisterly Syrian people and we demand an independent international investigation to guarantee the application of international law to everyone proven to use chemical weapons," the group said in a statement. In an opening speech, Saudi Arabia's King Salman also criticized Iran's "blatant interference in other countries." Iran is an ally of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and has been waging a proxy war in Yemen against Riyadh.

Though other league members, such as Iraq and Lebanon, had condemned the strikes. Despite being a strong ally of Washington, King Salman also took the opportunity to slam US President Donald Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
