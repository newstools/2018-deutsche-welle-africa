German police in the western town of Neustadt late Wednesday responded to a possible sexual abuse case, only to walk into an erotic bondage session – which they were then invited to join.

They were able to speak to both the woman and her partner, who police described as "well and in a good mood."

Neustadt police said the officers were invited to participate in the "training session" but had to "politely" turn down the offer.
