Syrian government air defenses have shot down missiles targeting Shayrat Airbase in the western province of Homs, state media reported on Tuesday. The apparent attack came days after the US, France and Britain conducted a coordinated missile attack against Syrian government targets. This area has also been targeted by the Israeli air force in the past. Hours later, however, sources cited by the DPA news agency denied there was an attack. According to them, the air defenses were activated early on Tuesday over what turned out to be a false alarm.
