DW: Muslim radicalization poses a serious challenge to British society, with many Muslim youths getting attracted to extremist narratives. What's pushing Muslim youngsters of South Asian background toward Islamism? Farid Panjwani: It is difficult to quantify the extent of Muslim youth radicalization in Britain. Also, we have to be clear about the definition of radicalization. Are we talking about people who are joining extremist organizations or those who just have extremist views? But I agree that there is definitely a general sense that things are not going well here. There is no single factor that is driving the youth toward extremism. The issues of identity, alienation, peer pressure, search for a cause, frustration with modernity and acceptance of certain mythological aspects of the Muslim history are all contributing factors.

These people have been living in the country for decades, then why do some South Asians harbor resentment against Western culture? Dr. Farid Panjwani: 'There is no single factor driving the youth toward extremism' Often, the resentment is not against Western culture but against specific elements within it. There is also a growing resentment against the Western establishment and its policies, particularly foreign policies. The reasons for this anger range from a personal sense of exclusion and a failure to come out with a systematic critique of colonial and post-colonial histories. But the resentment against the West, particularly against the US, is not restricted to Muslims; it is widely shared in many parts of the world, from Latin America to Africa, and even in Europe. Charles Taylor, a Canadian philosopher, writes about the malaise of modernity — about a feeling that something is not right at the core even though we seem to be making material progress. I think this feeling becomes more intense when combined with ideologies such as political Islam. Is social exclusion a reason behind the radicalization of some South Asian youths? If you look at the profiles of people who are involved in extremist activities, social exclusion doesn't come across as a ubiquitous reason behind radicalization. Some of those who were involved in July 7, 2005 terrorist attacks in Britain, for example, were very well adjusted in the country. On the other hand, there are extremists who had a difficult childhood, who commit petty crimes and end up in jail, where they get radicalized. So there are many reasons behind people's attraction to Islamist narratives. But social exclusion is definitely an issue that needs to be looked into. Many young Muslims are legal citizens of Britain yet they don't share a cultural bond with society. They feel the society has failed them and that they can't live up to their potential. These people are looking for some cause in life. Extremist groups and their recruiters are always looking for such people. But such feelings are widespread and can be found in white working class people also. This shows that we need to look into economic policies and political attitudes that have led to the erosion of social and welfare structures in society.

We must not start with the community. When you emphasize too much on community, it creates stigmatization and can make the matters worse. We need to see extremism, or extremisms, as a bigger problem. There are all kinds of extremisms in the world — a rising Hindu extremism in India, Buddhist extremism in Myanmar and elsewhere, white supremacism which promotes extremist ethno-nationalist ideologies. I see extremism as an outcome of the coming together of ideologies and socio-political conditions that make these ideologies attractive. Communities can definitely make sure how their religion is taught and can assist the state in confronting radicalism. It is primarily the responsibility of the state to tackle the issue of extremism among its citizens. The state must see extremists as individuals, as citizens, rather than representatives of a certain community. It needs to create capacities among its population to critique ideologies. It also needs to look at the economic and political conditions that make these ideologies attractive to individuals.

Do you agree with this viewpoint? Many people in capitalist societies feel they are not being heard, that democracy is not working, that corporations have too much power. They feel excluded. It is happening all over the world. In some cases people rally behind a strongman or extremist political parties or vote in favor of things like Brexit. Therefore, we have to look at the discontent among people and reflect on the democratic and citizenship models to find ways for people to have a bigger stake in society. It would not help if we insist on seeing Muslim extremists, or other extremist people, as crazy or mad who exist outside civilization. They have their own rationality, their own reasons for acting in a certain way. We can disagree with their reasons and condemn their acts but we must seek to understand and address what is motivating them. I have seen extremist material which weaves political narratives around conflicts in Palestine, Iraq and Kashmir with religious injunctions. It's a narrative that attempts to make young Muslims believe that they have a moral responsibility to come to the aid of their fellow members of the "ummah" (the perceived single Muslim community). To challenge this narrative, we need to take steps to resolve some longstanding political problems, reconsider certain economic policies, and come up with counter-narratives.

On October 1, 2017, A local Nevada retiree carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, killing 59 people and wounding hundreds more at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas. The Las Vegas massacre is just the latest in a string of mass shootings in the US this year. Before the attack in Las Vegas, the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida on June 12, 2016 was believed to be the deadliest in modern US history. Twenty-nine-year-old gunman Omar Mateen opened fire at the Pulse nightclub, killing 49 people and injuring dozens more. The US band Eagles of Death Metal were performing at the Bataclan in Paris on November 13, 2015 when gunmen stormed the concert venue. A total of 130 people were killed that night, including 89 at the Bataclan, in coordinated attacks by several groups of gunmen and suicide bombers at various locations throughout the French capital. The "Islamic State" claimed responsibility for the violence. A shooting during New Year's Eve celebrations at Istanbul's popular Reina nightclub on January 1, 2017 left 39 people dead and dozens more wounded. The "Islamic State" claimed responsibility for the attack that was carried out by a gunman from Uzbekistan. He was arrested just days later. The trial is still pending. A homemade bomb detonated on May 22, 2017 as concertgoers, including children, were leaving an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena. Twenty-two people, as well as the bomber, were killed, and roughly 250 more were injured. Police said 22-year-old Salman Abedi had acted alone but that others had been aware of his plans. On July 24, 2016, a Syrian refuge blew himself up in Ansbach in southern Germany, injuring more than a dozen people. The 27-year-old Syrian man, who had been denied entry to an open-air music festival because he did not have a ticket, detonated his bomb outside a wine bar. At Germany's Rock am Ring music festival, authorities suspected a terror plot possibly linked with local Islamists in the western state of Hesse when they were unable to identify two Syrian workers. As a precautionary measure, all 87,000 festivalgoers were evacuated from the concert grounds on opening night, June 2, 2017. It turned out to be a false alarm - the workers' names were misspelled.
