Dancila and her government did not consult Iohannis on the matter. As president, Iohannis is in charge of foreign policy and would be the one making the final decision on the embassy move. Iohannis warned that the move could violate international law. Dancila also made a state visit to Israel earlier this week, but left Romania without consulting the president ahead of time. Although Iohannis doesn't have the authority to remove Dancila, his demand for her resignation could put pressure on the government. Dancila became Romania's first female premier in January.
