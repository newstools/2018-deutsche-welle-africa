Current members include: The US, UK, Canada, France, Italy, Germany and Japan. Russia's transgressions: G7 countries have in recent years criticized Moscow's foreign policy, including its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, its intervention in the Syrian civil war and its cyber attacks on the US and European countries. US sends deputy: The US was represented at the G7 meeting in Canada by Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan. Mike Pompeo, who has been nominated to be the next US Secretary of State, could not attend because he still needs to be confirmed by the US Senate. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
