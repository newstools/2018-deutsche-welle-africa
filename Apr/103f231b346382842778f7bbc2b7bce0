Wine production tailed off in Europe during 2017, bringing down world production to its lowest level since 1957 according to the latest report from the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV). The fall has been blamed on poor weather conditions. Globally, the total volume produced in 2017 was 250 million hectoliters – the equivalent of 33.3 billion bottles of wine – or about four-and-a-half bottles per person annually.  Only 243 million hectoliters were drunk, so there was plenty to spare.

Cheaper wines could see an increase in price. Frost and storms take toll The French government said production last year had fallen so much because of poor weather conditions including spring frosts, drought and storms. Main growing regions including Bordeaux and Champagne were affected. The last time France had such a low volume of production was in 1957, when spring frost also destroyed grapes. Similar problems were seen in other parts of Europe.
