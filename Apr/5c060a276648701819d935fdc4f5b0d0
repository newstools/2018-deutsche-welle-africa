A 26-year-old man admitted in a court in the eastern German state of Thuringia on Monday to murdering his fellow student after she rejected his romantic advances. However, he denied allegations by the prosecution that he had sexually abused the young woman after her death. According to court documents, the man fell in love with his 22-year-old fellow student in the city of Nordhausen last year. The story goes that he expressed his feelings to her, and she told him that she was not interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with him.
