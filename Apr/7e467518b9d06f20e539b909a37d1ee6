The former president handed himself over to police custody on Saturday, following a tense standoff between his supporters and police. He is expected to be flown to the city of Curitiba to begin his 12-year prison sentence for corruption. Several thousand Workers' Party supporters and other activists had set up a human cordon earlier on Saturday around the union building where Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was holed up, refusing to hand him over to police after he lost his most recent appeal. The metalworkers' union headquarters in the southern city of Sao Bernardo do Campo has been the focus of supporters' attempts to keep Lula out of prison since a judge issued his arrest warrant on corruption charges on Thursday. Lula said on Saturday morning he would hand himself in to police in the southern city of Curitiba. "I will accept the arrest warrant," said the 72-year-old after attending a memorial mass in Sao Paulo for his wife, who died in 2017. When he stepped out to attend the street service, the crowd chanted: "Free Lula, free Lula!" In subsequent speech, he declared his innocence on charges of bribe-taking. "Helping Lula is helping the people. We will resist with him!" one young supporter told the French news agency AFP. Lula is still Brazil's most popular former leader, and had been the front-runner for October's presidential elections. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

The renovation was bankrolled by a company seeking contracts with the state oil giant Petrobras. He faces a jail term of 12 years and one month. Lula's several requests to stay out of jail until he had exhausted all appeals against his corruption conviction were rejected. The electoral court is widely expected to bar Lula from contesting the upcoming elections. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
