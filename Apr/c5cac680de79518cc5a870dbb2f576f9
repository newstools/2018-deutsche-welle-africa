"The election was an epic of love dedicated to Egypt," said head of the election commission, Lasheen Ibrahim. "It was an epic that embodied the struggle of the people for justice, dignity and democracy."

In January, el-Sissi's strongest challenger, General Sami Anan, was arrested over charges of running for office without permission. One day later, another serious contender, rights lawyer Khaled Ali withdrew, saying he and his supporters were being intimidated. Several other would-be candidates complained that massive efforts to kill their campaigns before they could even begin. "I wish there had been more candidates for people to choose who they want. But they were not ready yet," el-Sissi said in a televised address ahead of the election Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

According to Egyptian state media, US President Donald Trump called el-Sissi to congratulate him on his victory. The State Department said that the US "values its strong partnership with Egypt," but that the White House "noted reports of constraints on freedom of expression and association in the run-up to the elections." The turnout figure of 41 percent was down from 2014, the first election el-Sissi won outright, a year after Islamist president Mohamed Morsi was ousted in an uprising. Then, turnout was about 47 percent – but only after election officials agreed to extend the vote into a third day. es/rc (AFP, Reuters)
