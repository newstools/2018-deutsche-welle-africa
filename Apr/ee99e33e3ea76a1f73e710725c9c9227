All 29 NATO states were unanimous in their approval of the strikes given Russia's blocking of investigative efforts. The chemical attack: Dozens of people were reportedly killed and many more injured in a suspected chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma last week. Various groups alleged that either chlorine, a nerve agent, or both were used in the attack. Allegations of blame: Western allies accused the Russian-backed Syrian regime of being behind the attack. Russia and Syria denied this, saying the incident was either fabricated or was a false-flag attack. Retaliatory attacks: In response, the US, France and the UK launched attacks early Saturday morning against three sites near Damascus and Homs that were allegedly used for the research, development production, testing and storage of chemical weapons. New resolution: According to French Ambassador Francois Delattre, France, Britain and the US will soon present the Council with a new draft resolution aimed at achieving a lasting solution in Syria. aw/tj (Reuters, AFP, AP)
