The city of Venice on Saturday unveiled new turnstiles designed to limit the massive flows of tourists in its streets ahead of a busy long weekend. The World Heritage-listed city relies on tourism income, but residents have long complained about being overrun by tourists. Read more: Overtourism — where will it take us?

He said tourists are also important guests, but that he had a responsibility to the security of the residents of Venice. Local paper La Nuova Venezia reported some resistance from shopkeepers and major complaints from tourist boat operators forced to offload passengers in less-than-ideal locations. Police commander Marco Agostini told the paper he welcomed the experiment as a necessary measure. Venice - known also as the "Floating City" - has no roads accessible by car. It is an archipelago of 118 islands connected by numerous canals and bridges. Therefore, ferries and boats are the means of transport around the city. The Grand Canal - the major waterway of Venice - is 3.8 kilometers long and sweeps through the whole city. At a leisurely pace, the gondolier maneuvers through the quaint canals of Venice, gliding by historical sights and buildings. Although a touristy experience, a ride in one of these long, slim boats is a memory one never forgets; especially if the Gondolier sings a song or two. This intricate branch of architecture originated in Venice in the 14th century. It refers to the influence of Byzantine and Ottoman cultures in Gothic lancet arches in Venetian buildings. Glimpses of this style can be witnessed at the Doge's Palace, the Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti and the Ca' d'Oro among others. Venice is home to one of the most prominent opera houses in Italy. Teatro La Fenice - also known as "The Phoenix" - dates back to 1792 and has risen from the ashes after facing three fires. Adopting a modern approach to opera, this theater schedules regular shows of Giuseppe Verdi's "La Traviata" and Giacomo Puccini's "Madame Butterfly" to attract tourists. Venice has multiple names but none as intriguing as "City of Masks." The name stems from the distinctive masks worn during the annual carnival in Venice. There is a large variety of Venetian masks to choose from depending on individual tastes and budget. The uniqueness of each mask is put to the test during the carnival each year. Seafood lovers can definitely eat their way through Venice. With its unique location, the city has a fresh supply of fish and shellfish from its lagoon. One such traditional specialty of the region is Sarde in Saor, a simple but classic dish of sweet and sour sardines. Dating back to the 13th century, the dish is popular among the locals and is easily available throughout the city. A small fishing village located in the Venetian lagoon, Burano is a fun day trip. Its small houses are brightly painted, creating a rainbow colored backdrop - perfect for popping Instagram photographs. Burano is easily accessible by Venetian water bus from St. Mark's Square. The Lido is the barrier island between the Venetian lagoon and the Adriatic Sea. With golden sand dunes and private beaches, the Lido offers a relaxed vibe and is famous for hosting the Venice International Film Festival - the oldest film festival in the world - every year. Glass blowing is an old art in Venice, centered on the island of Murano. The skillful and intricate craftsmanship of the glassmakers stretches from glass vases to exquisite jewelry and chandeliers. These glass objects are the perfect souvenir to help support the local industry and take a part of Venice back home. Every year millions of tourists arrive in Venice on giant cruise ships. This has led to a dispute with the locals of Venice who consider the presence of cruise ships in their city an eyesore. There are also environmental concerns raised from the presence of the cruise ships in the lagoon and alternative docking facilities have been demanded.

The crush has given rise to slogans such as such as "Tourists Go Home" and "Tourists Are Terrorists" being scrawled across the city and has even prompted UNESCO to consider placing Venice on its list of World Heritage Sites in danger. Temporary measure: The measures imposed will initially only last for the weekend, but the city government is under pressure to manage crowd numbers throughout the busy summer season.
