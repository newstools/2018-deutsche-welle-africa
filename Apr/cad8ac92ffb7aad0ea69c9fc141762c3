The area was under almost constant Serb siege for most of the conflict. The prosecutor's office said Dudakovic and others were suspected of having carried out atrocities against hundreds of ethnic Serb and Bosnian civilians and prisoners during the war. It said the case against them was based on more than 100 witness interviews, video footage and evidence from exhumations.

He became the army's top commander after the war. Dudakovic was the wartime commander of the Bosnian army's 5th Corps The war in Bosnia erupted in 1992 when ethnic Serbs, who made up some 32.5 percent of the population, rejected the result of a referendum that would have paved the way for the country to emerge as an independent state from the disintegrating former Yugoslavia. They supported a continued union with Serbia, setting them at odds with Bosniaks and Croats who wanted an end to Belgrade's dominance. It is estimated that some 100,000 people were killed during the conflict, during which all three ethnic groups suffered atrocities.
