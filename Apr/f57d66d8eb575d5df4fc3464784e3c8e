Step into Hall 17, and you'll see them everywhere — big ones lifting car tires and pallets, small ones working with smartphone batteries, sorting tiles or even picking up and moving golf balls like chicken eggs. Robots are eye-catching but hardly a novelty at the Hannover Messe, the world's largest industrial exposition. Deployed regularly in large and small assembly lines, they've become a permanent part of an increasingly automated production process. Hanover offers a picture of where automation is heading, and how it's broadening its appeal. Machines are being networked more extensively, introduced into new fields and turned toward businesses and legacy manufacturers that may be late to — or only now comfortable with —the idea of networking their production. Behind it all is competition and market demand. Customers, whether the end-user or another business, expect their products to arrive more rapidly. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

"We want to deliver something within an hour, within 30 minutes in special cases." Positive sign for German industry The broadening embrace of automation is a positive sign for the future German economy in particular, analysts say. Many feared that the country's celebrated class of small- and mid-sized enterprises — its Mittelstand — was content to stick with its current success and leave disruptive innovation to smaller firms and startups. Yet the smaller firms and startups most eager to experiment with new applications often lack the resources of larger, more established businesses. Hanover coined the term "Industry 4.0" several years ago in a bid to bring the two sides together, an effort that analysts say is finally paying off. A recent study by the German digital association Bitkom found that German firms are moving progressively toward connecting their machines. Every fourth machine was smart" or networked, and firms are working more often with other firms instead of outside consultants, according to the poll of more than 500 industries.

AI is based on machine learning, or the concept that software can use a baseline set of rules to sort information and then apply it without explicit programming instructions. Technology platforms around the world already use AI, most commonly for refining search functions, where computers can improve search results based on past user actions. The applications for industry are widespread, however, according to a 2017 report by consultant firm McKinsey & Company. AI can help businesses with predictative maintenance for their factory floor machines, and it can speed up research and development by running virtual scenarios, similar to games, in which software learns what works and what doesn't. Hanover shows companies how those collaborations can work. Toyota Material Handling — a division of the Japanese carmaker which makes warehouse equipment like forklifts — is working with Microsoft to develop drone product-movers in its warehouse. Although a few years from production, the collection of forklifts and dollies will be programmed to communicate with one another as they move small parcels across warehouse floors. The software learns first in a virtual environment created by Microsoft. Given certain rules, the virtual drones navigate the layout of the warehouse while applying their rules and then receiving negative and positive feedback. Whenever they learn a lesson — say, by crashing into another drone — they share the information with other drones. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

"Instead of spending hours, manhours and manhours of programming of how to locate within a warehouse or a 3D type of environment, now you can use a program to train and deep-learn on its own." Retrofitting Even older production floors stand to benefit from automation. Many exhibitors in Hanover are offering retrofit technology. "It comes down to the fact that we have these production floors already," said Detlef Zühlke, the executive chairman of one such company in Germany, SmartFactory. "How do we bring them into a digitalized future?" There are challenges ahead. Workers need to be trained to work with automation. And because automation requires the fast movement of massive data loads, networks need to be extended and developed further. Network reach has been a challenge in Germany especially, something the new government has promised to remedy. "This has to happen with the networks in place," Zühlke said of future technology and training. "And I trust that the promises made in the coalition agreement will actually take place this time." It is 4,200 meters long and connects 36 attractions: this red line painted on the ground runs right through the center of Hanover. Visitors can follow it in order to get to know the State capital of Lower Saxony. A brochure and an app explain all you need to know about the stops along the way. It includes sights such as the old town center (pictured) and the Lower Saxony parliament building. The red line also leads to the Kröpcke - a place in the heart of the city and part of an expansive pedestrian area. It is named after a café which has been on this place since 1870. One of its features is the Kröpcke clock, which has become a popular meeting place for folks wanting to shop in the many outlets in the streets surrounding this place. Another stop on the red line is the New Town Hall, very much a Hanover landmark. The name seems strange as the building dates back to the era of Wilhelm II over a century ago. But that still makes it newer than the Old Town Hall which dates from 1410. Inside it there are four models depicting the town in different eras and an angled lift which takes visitors to the top of the dome. The New Town Hall is where the Maschsee begins - for many in Hanover the best feature of the city. The artificial lake is one of the most popular excursion destination and recreational area. Sailing, swimming, jogging: that's how the city folk like to spend their free time here. The three week Maschsee Festival draws some two million people to the shores and on to the waters of lake every year. Another green area in town are the gardens surrounding Herrhausen Palace, the former summer residence of the house of Welf. At the heart of it is the Great Garden. Comprising 50 hectares of lawns, hedges, walkways, and statues arranged in strict geometrical patterns, it was created in 1666 for Sophia of Hanover. The gardens are open to the public all year. Hanover is home to a number of museums. Probably one of the best known ones is the Sprengel Museum, showing 20th century art covering German expressionism and French modern art. Very noticeable is artist Niki de Saint Phalle, who became known for her Nana sculptures. She donated 400 works of art to the Sprengel Museum. In Hanover you don't have to go to a museum to see a Niki de Saint Phalle Nana sculpture. The Three Nanas - known as Sophie, Charlotte and Caroline - were initially contentious but are now popular. A flea market around the Nana sculptures in the old town center has been held every Saturday for more than 45 years. Here you won't find new or mass produced items but loads of jumble, art and kitsch. In Hanover Zoo there are no cages, the enclosures are designed to recreate the natural environment. More than 2,000 animals live here in seven different themed areas. Among the areas is the African river landscape Zambezi, which is home to lions, rhinoceros and giraffes - or Kibongo, the world of the great apes. Hanover might seem average in many ways, but when it comes to the Schützenfest it stands out! It is the largest marksmen's funfair in the world, with some 10,000 participants joining the march of the marksmen. On this traditional parade, marksmen, bands, dance groups and festive floats move through the center of town to the funfair area, where rides and food vans are already expecting them. Hanover might not have traditional foods like Bavaria's Haxn pig trotters or Weisswurst sausages, but it does have the Lüttje Lage drink! It is an alcoholic beverage which consists of a mix of beer and Korn grain-schnapps - which is drunk in a very particular way. How it's done is shown on the picture. To this, let's toast to your next visit to Hanover: "Prost!" Author: Elisabeth Yorck von Wartenburg
