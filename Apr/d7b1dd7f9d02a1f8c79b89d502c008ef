Saudi Arabia's first cinema in nearly 35 years will open later this month, the governmental Center for International Communication (CIC) said on Wednesday. US movie theater giant AMC Entertainment plans to open Saudi Arabia's first cinema in the capital Riyadh on April 18, it said in a statement. "The Saudi market is very large, with the majority of the population under the age of 30 and eager to watch their favorite films here at home," said Saudi Minister of Culture and Information Awwad Alawwad. The ultra-conservative kingdom announced in December it would lift a 35-year-old ban on cinemas. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is on a modernization and liberalization drive, seeking to open up the country of 30 million people and create a new image promoting "moderate Islam."
