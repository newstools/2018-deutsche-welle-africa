Apple and Irish finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, were set to sign the formal legal agreement that will allow Ireland to collect some €13 billion ($16 billion) in past taxes from the tech giant following orders from the European Commission, the Irish finance ministry announced Tuesday. While the signing means that Apple can start making back payments that span a decade to the European Union nation, both parties continue to dispute that Ireland gave Apple preferential tax treatment amounting to illegal state aid.

However, he added that "The [Irish] Government fundamentally disagrees with the ruling of the Commission" in 2016 that ordered the country to collect around €13 billion plus interest from Apple. A EU Commission spokesperson said that it hoped the back tax would be recovered as quickly as possible.

The EU body said that Apple paid an effective coroporate tax rate equal to just €50 for every million of its 2014 profits. What is the disagreement? Apple and Ireland both say that the company's tax treatment followed both Irish and EU law. Furthermore, the EU has taken Ireland to court over delays in the payment of back tax, but the Irish government has said it has acted as fast as it could. Why Ireland? The EU nation has courted major multinational companies such as Facebook, Google and Apple — all of which have their European headquarters in Dublin — by providing access to the EU single market with a low corporate tax rate. Upcoming appeal: Donohoe told journalists that an appeal by Ireland and the tech company against the payments would likely begin this fall.
