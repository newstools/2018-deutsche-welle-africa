The global NGO Open Society Foundations (OSF) has decided to close it Budapest office, Austria's Die Presse newspaper reported on their website on Thursday, following a years-long campaign against the OSF founder George Soros in Hungary. OSF chief and former US ambassador Patrick Gaspard personally traveled to Budapest to inform the local staff, according to the paper. The OSF now reportedly aims to open a new office in Berlin during the summer of 2018. The Hungarian news web site 444.hu said the Open Society Foundations office would close by the end of August. Hungarian-born US billionaire George Soros established the OSF in the early 1990s with the aim of promoting democracies in formerly communist states of eastern Europe. However, the organization has faced intense pressure in Hungary after right-wing nationalist Viktor Orban took power in 2010. Orban and his allies have portrayed Soros as a powerful and sinister figure intent on undermining the power of the state and reversing Orban's strict anti-migrant policies.

Others have argued that the campaign against Soros, who is Jewish and a Holocaust survivor, was anti-Semitic. The government has repeatedly shrugged off such criticism. The Hungarian prime minister is currently pushing a legislation dubbed the "Stop Soros" plan to crack down on NGOs and their foreign founders. Late last year, a ruling party politician posted a photo of a dead pig with Soros' name on it.

The 200-strong list includes academics, NGO employees, journalists and politicians. Many of the people listed teach at another Budapest-based project funded by George Soros, the Central European University. Hungary's government has also threatened to force CEU out of the country. According to Die Presse, authorities in the Austrian city of Vienna pledged a space that CEU could use as a back-up campus in case it needs to leave Hungary.
