The US space agency NASA, which contracted the launch, said the spacecraft was carrying more than 2,600 kilograms (5,800 pounds) of supplies and equipment for the ISS. The cargo included materials that ISS astronauts would use to conduct experiments on how human beings and plants behave in space, the agency said.
