The baby is her and Prince William's third child, following Prince George, aged four, and Princess Charlotte, who turns three in May. The boy is Queen Elizabeth II's sixth great-grandchild and fifth in line to the throne, after grandfather Prince Charles, father Prince William and the two older siblings.

In a mix of royal tradition and modernity, the birth will be announced with a notice placed on an easel at Buckingham Palace — and on royal social media accounts. Bets are open as for the name of the baby. Bookmakers say traditional royal names such as Arthur and James are the most popular guesses. Monday is St. George's Day, England's national day, but the name is already taken by the baby's big brother. Like its older siblings, the baby's full title will be His Royal Highness, Prince, followed by several given names. eg/ng (Reuters, AP, AFP)
