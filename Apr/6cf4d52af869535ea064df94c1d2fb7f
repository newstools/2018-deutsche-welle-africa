The business, which has interests in construction, as well as logistics and media, said it "formally denied" any wrongdoing. A Guinean government spokesman told the Reuters news agency that the government was "not concerned by these allegations, which make no sense." The news that Bollore had been arrested caused group stocks to fall by more than four percent in mid-morning Paris trading. rc/rt (AFP, AP, Reuters)
