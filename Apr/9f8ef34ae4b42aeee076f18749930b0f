A parcel bomb delivered to the Handwerkskammer trades association in Berlin last week was another attempt to blackmail German logistics giant DHL, investigators said on Tuesday. "It is highly likely that the package was sent by the perpetrator or perpetrators who are trying to blackmail package delivery service DHL for millions (of euros)," said Torsten Herbst, a spokesman for the Brandenburg police department.

A worker became suspicious after noticing wires protruding from the package. Police cleared the trade association building and surrounding street during the bomb scare. A bomb disposal team diffused the bomb without an explosion being set off. Police said the size of the package meant that it could have seriously injured people had it exploded. The bomb package was the fourth believed to be part of the extortion scheme against DHL in recent months.
