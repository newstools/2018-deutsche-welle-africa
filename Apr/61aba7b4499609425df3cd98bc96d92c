The state court in Schleswig ruled on Thursday there was no reason to believe that Catalonia's former leader Carles Puigdemont risked persecution in Spain. It set bail at €75,000 ($92,000) while a decision was made on his possible extradition to Spain. The court in northern Germany ruled that the main charge of rebellion in the Spanish case against Puigdemont could not be used as the comparable German charge of treason specifies violence. The court is to consider his extradition on the basis of misuse of public funds. Puigdemont can leave prison as soon as he posts the bail, a court spokeswoman said on Thursday.

The former Catalan separatist leader was detained in Germany last month on an international arrest warrant issued by Spain when he was driving back from Finland through Denmark on his way to Belgium. He had been living there after being charged by Spanish authorities with rebellion and misuse of public funds in last year's independence referendum. Little 'risk of flight' The Schleswig court considered him to be less of a flight risk because he is being considered for the corruption, not rebellion, charges. "There is a risk of flight," the court said in its explanation. "But since extradition on rebellion charges is impermissible, the risk of flight is substantially lessened." In addition to the payment, the terms of Puigdemont's bail are that he may not leave Germany; he has to advise if he changes address; he has to report to the court once a week and must obey orders from the Higher Regional Court. Spanish Justice Minister Rafael Catala said the government respected the German court's decision to rule out the rebellion charge from the extradition request.
