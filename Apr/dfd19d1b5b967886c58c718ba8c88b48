Both men fell short of the 40 percent threshold to avoid a second round run-off vote. Split opinions: Both took diametrically opposed stands on a January ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR), which urged member countries to recognize same-sex marriage. Carlos supported the ruling, while Fabricio opposed it, with the latter Alvarado threatening to remove Costa Rica from the court. Who is being replaced? Carlos will replace former President Luis Guillermo Solis, a member of the Citizens' Action Party, who was elected in 2014. Solis' popularity fell during his time in office amid a corruption scandal and his strong support for gay rights. amp/aw (AFP, Reuters) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of news and features.
