Two German Islamic State (IS) wives returned to Germany Thursday, on board a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt. They are said to have been in a northern Iraqi jail in Kurdish Erbil before returning. German federal prosecutors claim the women are radical Islamists, but their request for an arrest warrant was denied by Germany's Federal Supreme Court (BGH).

On high alert: Germany, along with other European countries, has greeted the fall of Islamic State but is also wary of the threat presented by the return of nationals who joined the radical group. Not alone: German intelligence services estimate that more than 960 Islamists traveled from Germany to join IS in Syria and Iraq and that roughly one-third have already returned. js/rt (AFP, dpa)
