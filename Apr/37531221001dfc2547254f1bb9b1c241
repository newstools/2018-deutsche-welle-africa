Prosecutors investigating the death of pop star Prince announced on Thursday that their two-year probe had not found "sufficient evidence to charge anyone with a crime." However, the Minnesota prosecutor's announcement came just hours after federal authorities revealed that the doctor initially suspected of prescribing the opioid that killed Prince had agreed to pay a $30,000 (€24,000) settlement with US federal prosecutors.

The drug is only available in the US by prescription but is often abused addicts and sold illegally. Prince did not have a prescription for fentanyl. Carver County Attorney Mark Metz said that "nothing in the evidence suggests Prince knowingly ingested fentanyl" and that he thought he was taking Vicodin, the trade name for another opioid combined with paracetamol. Thursday's announcement effectively closes the state of Minnesota's investigation into the death of one of its most famous and beloved stars.

Oxycodone is not linked to the singer's death. Addressing the federal charges filed against Prince, Metz said his office found that the physician had made out the prescription to one of Prince's associates to protect the singer's privacy, which is illegal. Nevertheless, there was "no evidence that the pills that killed Prince were prescribed by a doctor," the state prosecutor added. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

If he does not comply, he would risk losing his medical license. Minnesota's top federal prosecutor, US Attorney Greg Brooker, vowed to pursue other doctors who abuse prescription handouts. "Doctors are trusted medical professionals and, in the midst of our opioid crisis, they must be part of the solution," he said in a statement Thursday.

The most recent figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that some 63,000 people died from a drug overdose in the US in 2016. Around two thirds of those deaths were linked to opioid use, a surge of 28 percent from the year before.
