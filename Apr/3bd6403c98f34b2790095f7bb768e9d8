The federal government plans to increase financial compensation for the families of those killed in terrorist attacks to €30,000 ($36,000), the German commissioner for victims said Monday. "The attack [on the Christmas market in Berlin] in December 2016 showed that there's a lot that needs to be improved," Commissioner Edgar Franke told the Rheinische Post newspaper in an interview. Twelve people were killed and more than 70 were injured when Anis Amri, an "Islamic State" supporter from Tunisia, plowed a truck into a Christmas market at Berlin's Breitscheidplatz on December 19, 2016.

Franke said that level of support was "far too low," adding that the aim was to "increase hardship benefits for the surviving relatives from €10,000 to €30,000 and from €5,000 to €15,000."

"Of course we hope there will be no more terror attacks," he said. "But still, we have to prepare for such a case and create appropriate structures. Victims and survivors must be helped quickly and without too much bureaucracy." Read more: Berlin Christmas market attack: 'We weren't prepared' Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

Many accused authorities of not providing them with timely information or enough financial support. Outrage was also directed at Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was criticized for initially failing to personally acknowledge  the victims. Last December, one year after the attack, Merkel invited victims' families to the Chancellery, and promised that Germany would improve support for victims and change how it deals with such incidents in the future. nm/msh (AFP, dpa, KNA, epd) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
