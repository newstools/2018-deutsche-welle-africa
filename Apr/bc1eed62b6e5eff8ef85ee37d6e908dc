The German coalition government is considering a plan to retrofit diesel cars affected by the emissions scandal, according to a report in German news weekly Der Spiegel on Friday. Diesel car owners in Germany have been left in the lurch as they face potential city driving bans as well as lousy resale values due to multiple car makers cheating on emission tests and being unwilling to physically rectify the issues.

The process would initially target diesel engines for which retrofit kits already exist, mainly US export models. The retrofitting would initially take place in regions under threat of driving bans, namely Stuttgart, the Rhine-Main area and Munich.

Still, environmentalists say that's not enough. They want all diesel vehicles – including private cars – retrofitted, or taken off the road. Milan, one of Italy's most polluted cities, has banned cars from its downtown area during certain hours. Other cities in Italy and abroad have experimented with similar schemes, for example permitting only cars with odd or even license plates on the road at given times in order to limit the amount of traffic. The Macedonian capital of Skopje is battling with pollution levels up to 15 higher than permitted by the EU – though it's not yet a member state so isn't facing fines. Macedonia's smog problem is largely down to burning coal and emissions from aging, inefficient industry and vehicles. To get people to leave their dirty old cars at home, the government has introduced free public transport. One street in London exceeded the EU's annual nitrogen dioxide limit on January 30 – less than a month into 2018. Actually, this is an improvement – it's the first time in a decade the British capital has kept within the annual limit for more than six days. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has announced he wants to alert the city's schools on days when pollution is particularly bad. Author: Sarah Steffen Government dampens expectations A Federal Ministry of Finance spokesman said there should be no government spending for projects outside of the priority measures outlined in the coalition agreement. "The program mentioned in the report is not one of these priority measures and is not known to the Federal Ministry of Finance.” Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer told the German Press Agency: "We will be working hard in Meseberg (at a coalition meeting next week) with the aim of improving the air quality in our cities even further. Our guideline is the coalition agreement." A spokesman for the Federal Environment Ministry said: "We need to retrofit older diesel cars. This is the only way to improve the air quality in the cities and the only way to avoid driving bans and stop the loss in value of diesel engines. It is the task of the Federal Ministry of Transport to implement this." SPD deputy faction leader Sören Bartol said: "Industry has to make a choice: Either the diesel will be completely up against the wall when urban driving is banned, or it has another chance as a bridge technology."

Millions of German-made diesel cars, from various manufacturers, were rigged to defeat emissions tests. German carmakers have been accused of organizing a secret cartel to collaborate on emission controls, standards, technology, costs and suppliers for years. In light of this, various German cities have been pushing to ban diesel engines from their highly polluted centers. Judges ruled in late February that such bans are legal if they are used to reduce levels of harmful fine particles and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the air. The government has been trying to avoid any such bans. The current government is formed of a coalition between Angela Merkel's CDU, its Bavarian sister party the CSU, and the Social Democrats. Before committing to govern together they put together a contract that outlines the road map for the next few years. The Grand Coalition will meet for its first closed meeting this Tuesday and Wednesday in the federal government's guesthouse in Meseberg Castle in Brandenburg.

Yet German brands make up less than two-thirds of all cars on German roads, which is still a male-dominated territory: Only one-third of all owners in 2017 were women. Interestingly, that number has virtually not changed over the past decade. German passenger vehicles, are growing steadily older, from 8.1 years a decade ago to 9.3 years in 2017, the highest-ever age. By the way: By no means is Germany the car capital of the world: It ranks 20th in motor vehicles per capita - 17 spots behind the US, where every 10 people own eight cars. The world's least motorized country? Togo. Roughly 600,000 vehicles - 13 percent of all cars on German roads - are considered vintage cars which means they are more than three decades old. 380,000 have a historic license plate, which requires the vehicle to be in "contemporary, original preservable condition." As of January 1, 2017, 45.8 million passenger vehicles were registered in Germany. Based on a population of 82.8 million, it translates to 684 cars per 1,000 people. Today, there are five times as many cars in Germany than there were half a century ago when roughly 9 million vehicles drove on the "Autobahn." The average passenger vehicle age in Germany varies from state to state. Maybe not surprisingly, cars in Bavaria, the home of BMW and the state with the highest economic per capita output, are the youngest at nine years, while the average vehicle on Brandenburg's roads, the state surrounding Berlin, is almost a decade old. While the number of gasoline-powered cars have remained remarkably stable over the past decade, their share steadily decreased to two-thirds of all engines in 2017. The number of diesel cars has risen from 10 to 15 million since 2008. Electric and hybrid cars combined made up 200,000 of all 45 million - that's 0.5 percent. In Norway, the share of electric vehicles alone is more than 1 percent.
