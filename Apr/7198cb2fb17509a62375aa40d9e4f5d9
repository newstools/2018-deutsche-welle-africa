A letter written by 19th-century German composer Richard Wagner in which he rails against Jewish culture will go up for sale at an Israeli auction house on Tuesday. The handwritten letter was sent to French author, philosopher and musicologist Edouard Schure. In the letter, Wagner details his anti-Semitic views on French and German Jews. He tries to explain the thoughts behind his notorious "Judaism in Music." Written under a pseudonym, the essay is an aggressive attack on Jews in general and on the Jewish composers Giacomo Meyerbeer and Felix Mendelssohn in particular. "We have not been confronted by controversy regarding this item," a representative of the auction house wrote in a statement responding to questions from DW. "An interesting facet of the auction of this letter is its attraction to collectors of anti-Semitic material on the one hand and to collectors of items related to Richard Wagner on the other hand," she added.

He went on to discuss the differences between German Jews and "true" Germans and alleged that the national press was entirely in Jewish hands. It is listed with a price guide of $8,000 to $12,000 (€6,500-9,800).

"Wagner would roll over in his grave" if he knew that a bearded Jew in Jerusalem was going to profit from his letter, Eren said. Ruth HaCohen, a musicology professor at Hebrew University, told AFP that the letter showed how Wagner wanted his anti-Semitic views to be accepted by the public. He said its sale in Jerusalem, of all places, was an "irony."

"Wagner has become a "symbol of the Holocaust," Livny said. The works of Wagner, Hitler's favorite composer, are rarely performed in Israel due to public outcry and disturbances.  aw/mkg (AFP)
