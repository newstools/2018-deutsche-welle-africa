Italy again failed to form a coalition government after two days of talks came to an end on Thursday. Italy had a general election on March 4 resulting in a hung parliament, since which once-fringe parties have squabbled over who should lead a potential coalition.

Silvio Berlusconi of Forza Italia - which is in a center-right alliance with Lega and Brothers of Italy- called for a government based on "clear agreements on concrete and feasible solutions, credible at European level."

Growing euroskepticism: The ruling Social Democrat PD party suffered an embarrassing defeat at the election, being leapfrogged by populist, euroskeptic parties. If the M5S and the League end up forming a coalition they could be headed for a collision course with the European Union. Coalition falls apart: A right-wing alliance consisting of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, Salvini's Lega and Brothers of Italy together took 37 percent of the vote. But Salvini's party usurped Berlusconi as the leader of that bloc and M5S is now demanding it break ranks with Forza Italia. New round: A second of negotiations will take place next week. aw/ng (dpa, Reuters, AFP) Read more: Matteo Salvini: Italy's far-right success story
