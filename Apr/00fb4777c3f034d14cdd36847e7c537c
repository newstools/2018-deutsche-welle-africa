Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a 50-year-old Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of the northern Uttar Pradesh state assembly, was arrested on Friday after a police interrogation. Sengar said the rape allegations against him were "politically motivated." The girl said she was raped in June last year in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao district and the police refused to register a case against Sengar despite her repeated efforts to report the alleged crime. The case made national headlines after the teenager tried to set herself on fire on April 8 in front of Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's home. A day later, the girl's father died in police custody after he was beaten by Sengar's brother, who was arrested after the incident. The teenager's family named four other people as Sengar's accomplices in the alleged rape.

Sengar's arrest comes just days after a brutal rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Jammu and Kashmir. Sordid and frightening details have emerged from the police charge sheet filed for the gang-rape of Asifa Bano in January this year.
