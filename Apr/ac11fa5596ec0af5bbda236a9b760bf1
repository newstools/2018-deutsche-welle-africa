After years of breakneck growth driven by exports and debt-fueled investment, authorities are increasingly worried about a possible credit crunch. China's trade balance swung to a rare deficit in March as exports shrank by 2.7 percent over a year earlier. Trade accounts for less of the country's economic activity than in earlier years, but still supports millions of jobs. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
