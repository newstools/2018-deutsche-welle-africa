Romanian President Klaus Iohannis rejected on Monday a request from the justice minister to sack the head of the anti-graft body DNA. "I was not convinced by the justice minister's arguments," Iohannis said in an address. Justice Minister Tudorel Toader had accused chief anti-corruption prosecutor Laura Kovesi of abuse of authority, violating the constitution and damaging Romania's image. In February, he launched a procedure to remove Kovesi, triggering protests in support of the popular anti-graft fighter. Only the president can remove the head of DNA. Iohannis, who is from the center-right, said he was "happy" with DNA's work. In response to the president's decision, Toader said on Facebook that he would take the issue to the constitutional court. Record number of corruption cases Romania's independent judicial watchdog has expressed a positive opinion of Kovesi. The EU has also praised her work.
