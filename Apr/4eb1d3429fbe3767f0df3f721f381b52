Russia has denied allegations that it interfered in the election and Trump has said there was no collusion between Russia and the US. He has previously called the Mueller probe a "witch hunt." The new recruits Giuliani had a notable career as a federal prosecutor before he became mayor of New York in 1994, a position he held until 2001. He was the Manhattan US Attorney for much of the 1980s, during which he brought many high-profile cases aimed at insider trading on Wall Street, and prosecuted stock trader Ivan Boesky and the firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Since he left the mayor's office, Giuliani has been in private practice, most recently at international law firm Greenberg Traurig. Giuliani has been an outspoken supporter of Trump ever since the early days of his presidential campaign. Martin Raskin led the criminal division for the US Attorney's Office in Miami in the early 1980s, while Jane Raskin prosecuted organized crime cases in Boston.
