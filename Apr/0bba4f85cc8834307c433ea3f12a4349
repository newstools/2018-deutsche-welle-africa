The army and police were deployed on the streets of the capital Managua and other cities Ortega said that the government would examine other ways to reform the pension system and improve its financial outlook. The protests were the biggest challenge faced by Ortega during his 11 years in power. The president has criticized protesters as criminal gangs and defended the government's response. "This has forced us to put the fight against gangs on our agenda, to fight them so that they don't keep on acting like this, so that they don't keep on killing each other or storming institutions," he said Sunday. "We must reestablish order, we will not allow chaos, crime and looting to reign." The European Union, the United States and the Vatican have voiced concern over the crackdown. cw/se (AFP, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
