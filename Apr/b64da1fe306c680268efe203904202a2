China's censorship laws not only allow authorities to closely monitor online user activity and purge the internet of any content it deems offensive. It also requires the websites themselves to hire their own censors to monitor content on their pages. This week, Toutiao, one of China's most popular news aggregator apps, was reprimanded by the government for allowing users to share lewd jokes and videos. The site subsequently promised to increase censorship to some 10,000 people. Read more: Germany, China to discuss law in the digital age Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
