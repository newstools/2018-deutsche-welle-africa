"IS is militarily defeated in Iraq, but more than two million people are still displaced," Müller said before his departure. "Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees must wait in Iraq until the murderous war in Syria has finally ended. Bridges, hospitals and entire cities were destroyed." "To prevent terrorism from regaining a foothold, it is important that people can return to their homes." "That's why we focus our aid on schoola and education for children and young people as well as reconstruction." Germany plans to give Iraq an additional €350 million ($431 million) for reconstruction this year, with most of the money going to projects for emergency aid and infrastructure reconstruction. The Federal Government hopes the program will help returned migrants to regain a foothold, through initiatives such as providing advice on setting up a business or vocational training programs. The program also includes cash-for-work programs, in which Iraqis help with reconstruction and receive an income in return.
