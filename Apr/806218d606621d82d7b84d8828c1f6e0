A 120-strong delegation of South Korean musicians and artists, including K-Pop singers Cho Yong Pil and Seohyun, performed in the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Sunday, in the presence of the isolated state's leader Kim Jong Un and his wife Ri Sol Ju. Kim clapped his hands as he watched the performance, the first by South Korean stars in 15 years, amid a thaw in relations with Seoul after years of tensions over the North’s nuclear program.

The two-hour concert was described by many as a cultural charm offensive by the South, and was triggered by the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, to which the North sent athletes, cheerleaders and Kim’s sister as an envoy.

Kim later shook hands and took photos with the stars backstage, and called for inter-Korean cultural events to be held more often. "Please tell (South Korean) President Moon Jae-in how great an event like this is... I am grateful for a gift like this (concert) to the people of Pyongyang," Kim told visiting Seoul officials. The last time South Korea sent a musical artist to perform in the north was in 2005 — during a previous period of reconciliation — but it is the first time a North Korean leader has attended such an event. Eleven musical acts as well as dancers, technicians and martial artists gave a concert for Kim on Sunday In a second concert by the K-pop stars on Tuesday, they will be joined on stage by several North Korean performers.
