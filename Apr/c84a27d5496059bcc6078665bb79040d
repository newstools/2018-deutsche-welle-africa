Forman died suddenly on Friday in the United States after a short illness, his wife, Martina, told CTK. "His departure was calm, and he was surrounded the whole time by his family and his closest friends," she said.

Forman was one of the most important directors of the Czechoslovak New Wave Distinguished filmmaker Before fleeing to the US, the acclaimed director joined the New Wave of filmmakers, who confronted the communist regime in former Czechoslovakia. Movies like "Black Peter" (1964), "Loves of a Blonde" (1965) and "The Fireman's Ball" (1967) remain memorable from that era. Forman's first overseas film was "Taking Off," which was released in 1971. This was followed by "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" four years later, featuring Jack Nicholson.
