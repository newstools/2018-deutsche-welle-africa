Indonesia's state-owned energy company on Thursday blamed "an external force" for damaging its undersea pipeline, which in turn caused a massive oil spill off the port city of Balikpapan on Borneo island. The spill has affected nearly 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres) of water and 60 kilometers (37 miles) of shoreline, forcing local officials to declare a state of emergency. The leaking oil caused a fire on a fishing boat and a ship carrying coal on Saturday and killed five people, while leaving more than a thousand sickened.

An energy ministry official said a coal ship with a Panamanian flag dropping anchor was likely to blame for the rupture. "We suspect the pipe was dragged by the ship that caught fire," Oil and Gas Director General Djoko Siswanto told reporters.
