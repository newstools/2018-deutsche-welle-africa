A court in Istanbul on Friday ordered the conditional release of Sahin Alpay more than a year after he was imprisoned, Turkish media reported. The ruling bars the journalist of the now-defunct Zaman daily from leaving Turkey and confines him to his house, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. Alpay was jailed over alleged ties to an attempted coup in Ankara in mid-2016. He denied the charges and has sought to challenge his imprisonment.

But a lower court rejected that finding and the pair remained locked up. Alpay then applied to the Constitutional Court for a second time. The outcome of that bid, decided on Friday, again found that his rights had been violated while in custody. The court also said the journalist should be paid 20,000 lira ($5,100; €4,150) in compensation.

Last month, Altan was handed a life sentence on charges of having ties to the coup's plotters. Alpay is facing trial on the same charge — as well as a life sentence if convicted. Both journalists have appealed to the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights. A ruling on their cases is expected next week. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
