A document presented Tuesday at China's National People's Congress revealed that the world's second-largest economy was to get a number of new ministries, including a more encompassing Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas as well as a Ministry for Ecology and Environment. The banking and insurance regulators would become a single entity, the paper said. The long-awaited move to streamline and tighten oversight of the $42-trillion (â‚¬34-trillion) banking and insurance sectors comes as authorities seek more clout to crack down on riskier lending practices and reduce high corporate debt levels. "Deepening the reform of state institutions is an inevitable requirement for strengthening the long-term governance of the party," said Liu He, President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser.
