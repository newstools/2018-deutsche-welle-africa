A homemade bomb exploded at a FedEx distribution center in Texas early Tuesday morning, injuring one person in the fifth such incident in the state this month, officials said. The bomb detonated just after midnight at the FedEx facility in the city of Schertz, northeast of San Antonio. The package had been bound for Austin, the state capital and location of previous deadly blasts, the Washington Post quoted the FBI as saying. In a statement on social media, the Schertz Police Department said one person received medical assistance at the scene.

The most recent blast follows four other bombs that killed two people and injured six others over the past month. Last week, officials said they believed the first four bombs were the work of a serial bomber. Officials at the scene of the second bombing on March 12 "We are investigating it as being possibly related to our open investigation," FBI spokeswoman Michelle Lee told the Austin American-Statesman newspaper. "We can't know for sure until we have an opportunity to look at the evidence itself," she added. The Tuesday blast comes after an explosion on Sunday night  that was triggered on a street by an almost invisible tripwire, suggesting a "higher level of sophistication" than agents had seen in previous bombings. The three earlier incidents involved package bombs that were left on doorsteps, meaning officials now believe the bombings have been done at random, rather than being targeted at someone in particular. Potential hate crimes Austin police chief Brian Manley said police have not been able to determine a motive for the bombings, but police had looked at the possibility of hate crimes. The first two bombs killed black men and investigators believed the third, which left a Latina woman injured, may have been intended for a black family's home, police said. law/kl (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)
