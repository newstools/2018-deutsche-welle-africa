A Swiss court has sentenced a German man to nine yearsÂ imprisonment for killing his mentally-challenged daughter. The man is said to have trampled his 25-year-old daughter to death in an effort to exorcise a demon. The prosecution presented videos demonstrating the brutal assaults using a life-size straw puppet. The videos displayed how the man stood on his daughter as she lay on the floor and forcefully kicked her in the stomach. The prosecutors also accused the man of raping his dead daughter in an effort to revive her. Autopsy reports showed that the girl died of internal injuries.
