Last month, Sartor defended the decision saying roughly 75 percent of the people who went to Tafel locations in the city were foreigners. He said the board believed the figure was too high. The Essen Tafel, like others across the country, operates by providing membership cards to those in need. One card is allotted per family. In order to qualify, a potential member must be a beneficiary of social assistance. Similar food banks across Germany criticized the decision to stop serving foreigners Widespread criticism At the time, board member Rita Nebel said despite roughly 6,000 people covered by Tafel Essen membership, "you could sometimes pick the few German people out of the crowd at the food handovers." Following the decision, six of the food bank's delivery vans and the entrance of one of its locations were vandalized with phrases like "F*** Nazis."

On Sunday, Sartor said the decision still came down to numbers: "The numbers have moved back towards balance. By the end of the month, we assume that they'll be back to a ratio that's acceptable to us." Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
