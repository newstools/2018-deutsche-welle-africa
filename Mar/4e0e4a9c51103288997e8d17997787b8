Eintracht Frankfurt President Peter Fischer used an interview with public broadcaster WDR on Wednesday to call for an end to Monday evening kickoffs, which have been unpopular with many German fans. Fischer conceded that the clubs, including his own, had agreed to introduce Monday night kickoffs, ostensibly to make it easier on teams involved in the Europa League, which plays its games on Thursday. "We all supported it, because it was about money," he said. "This was about money, and playing on a Monday brought extra funds into our club." He also indicated that the extra revenue was a "manageable sum," indicating that doing without it should not pose a major problem for his club or the league. A lesson learned "We have learned what Bundesliga football on Mondays means," the 61-year-old Fischer said with a view to fan protests at Eintracht's home game against Leipzig two weeks ago. These were followed a week later by protests and a partial fan boycott of Dortmund's home match against Augsburg.

However, he also said he was optimistic that the league, the clubs and the broadcast rights holder would all come to the conclusion that holding Bundesliga matches on Monday nights wasn't good for anyone involved, and that they come up with a way to avoid scheduling them in future. "If you have nobody in the stands, nobody in the stadium is waving a flag, or booing or cheering, it makes for a pretty dull television broadcast," he concluded.
