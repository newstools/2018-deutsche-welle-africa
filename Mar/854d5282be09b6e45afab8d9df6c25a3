The European Commission on Wednesday presented its strategy for responding to US President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Plans included possible measures targetting US products like peanut butter, orange juice and bourbon whisky. European Council President Donald Tusk hit back at Trump, saying trade wars are "easy to lose," and that the EU would retaliate against the planned US steel and aluminum tariffs.

and  reality "President Trump has recently said, and I quote, 'trade wars are good and easy to win' but the truth is quite the opposite. Trade wars are bad and easy to lose," Tusk told a press conference in Luxembourg. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

He suggested that there should be "an extraordinary trade debate" over possible "repercussions for our citizens and our businesses not to mention the global economy," at an upcoming EU leaders summit in Brussels this month. "We ... hope to convince the US administration that this is not the right move," EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said. "But we have made clear that if a move like this is taken, it will hurt the European Union, it will put thousands of European jobs in jeopardy, and it has to be met by a firm and proportionate response," she added. US motive an 'economic safeguard' Trump's motivations did not appear compatible with World Trade Organization rules and that meant the EU could take precautions to protect its own markets, Malmstroem said. She added that the EU "seriously doubts" Trump wanted tariffs on steel for national security reasons. "We have serious doubts about that justification. We cannot see how the European Union, friends and allies in NATO, can be a threat to international security in the US," Malmstrom said. "From what we understand, the motivation of the US is an economic safeguard measure in disguise, not a national security measure," she added. Last Thursday Trump declared that the US would impose a 25-percent tariff on steel imports and a 10-percent tariff on aluminum. Then on Saturday he tweeted threatening that the US would place "a tax" on European cars that "freely pour into the US" if the EU further increased tariffs. law/sms (AFP, AP, dpa)
