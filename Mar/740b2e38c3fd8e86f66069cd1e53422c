An avalanche swept through an area near Entraunes in the French Alps on Friday, killing at least four people, police said in a statement. One person was taken to hospital with injuries, while the group's guide escaped unharmed. Another individual is still unaccounted for. The group was reportedly skiing off-piste in a remote part of the Mercantour National Park when the avalanche struck just after midday. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told reporters that a rescue operation was underway.

According to Jean-Gabriel Delacroy of the Alpes-Maritimes prefecture, warmer temperatures since Thursday have destabilized the fresh buildup of snow.

A total of 20 people have died on mountain slopes since France's ski season began in November. Last month, an avalanche swept away a man and his 11-year-old daughter in the alpine resort of Val d'Isere. A number of other skiers were also killed in separate incidents in the Pyrenees.
