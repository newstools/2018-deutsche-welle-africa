Project goal: Empowering women and integrating gender as well as social aspects into urban climate policies in several pilot cities around the world. Climate Impact: An equal society has better prospects of protecting their environment. By integrating social issues such as poverty alleviation and gender equality into urban climate policy, cities are presented with an opportunity to enhance their response to climate issues. Project countries: South Africa, Indonesia and India. Project financing:  €969,946 ($1,184,536) provided by Germany's Federal Ministry for the Environment (BMUB) through the International Climate Initiative (IKI). Project partners: GenderCC Southern Africa, Aksi!, Solidaritas Permpuan, All India Women's Conference. Women are more likely to die as a consequence of drought, flooding or heat waves. And — as long as political and economic power lies with men — they will continue to find it more difficult adapt to dramatic changes in their environment resulting from climate change, says climate and gender activist, Ndivile Mokoena. Mokoena works for GenderCC, an organization that promotes gender equality in climate protection worldwide. The South African engages internationally and in her home country to get women involved in climate policy and projects. In Johannesburg, Mokoena helps educate women in urban farming practises, which she hopes will not only help them adapt to climate change but will also increase their independence.
