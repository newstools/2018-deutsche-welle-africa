Zhong Shan, China's minister of commerce, said Sunday there would be "no winners in a trade war, and it would bring disaster to [China and the United States] as well as the rest of the world." "China does not wish to fight a trade war, nor will China initiate a trade war, but we can handle any challenge and will resolutely defend the interests of our country and our people," Zhong said on the sidelines of China's annual parliamentary session in Beijing.

Set to come into effect in 15 days, the new policy includes exceptions for imports from Mexico and Canada. Calling steelworkers the "backbone of America," Trump called steel vital to US national security. He added that foreign steel dumping was an "assault" that put US companies and factories out of business. He urged companies to buy American steel and thus avoid import tariffs.

South Korea, Japan, China and India accounted for 6.6 million tones of steel imports. Although the US does not import a large quantity of steel from China, the Asian country's unprecedented industry expansion in the past decade has added to global surpluses of steel, thus driving down metal prices. Last year, the US posted a $375 billion (€304 billion) deficit with China. But China's commerce minister Zhong said the Trump administration was overstating the US trade deficit with China by about 20 percent annually. He instead blamed the imbalance on US controls over high-tech exports to China. Beijing says Washington could reduce a trade deficit by allowing it to purchase advanced materials with military applications. The US government believes such sales would make up only a marginal deficit and could put the US national security under threat.
