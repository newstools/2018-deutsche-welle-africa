He was made a cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. Lehmann was known for his relatively liberal views on abortion counseling and allowing divorced and remarried people receive communion. These sometimes made him a controversial figure among more conservative Catholics. Lehmann had a stroke last September, which badly affected his health.

Merkel praised him as an "exceptionally gifted mediator" not only between German Catholics and Rome but also between the Catholic Church and other Christian denominations as well as believers of other religions. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier called Lehmann a "man of clear words" and "one of the important bridge-builders between the denominations and religions." The current chairman of the German Bishops' Conference, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, praised Lehmann as "a great theologian, bishop and friend to humankind." The Central Council of Jews in Germany said Lehmann had always worked for good relations between Christians and Jews with great sensitivity and intelligence. Lehmann's funeral mass is scheduled for March 21 in Mainz Cathedral. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
