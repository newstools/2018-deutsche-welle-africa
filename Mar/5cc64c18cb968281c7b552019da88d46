The leaders of North and South Korea have agreed to a summit meeting in late April, a top security adviser of South Korean President Moon Jae-in announced Tuesday. Both countries have also agreed to set up a telephone hotline between their leaders. But the decision to organize a meeting between Moon and the North's leader Kim Jong Un was probably one of the easiest items for the two sides to agree upon. It's too early to predict if this summit will yield any positive results in terms of reducing tensions between North Korea and the US. Washington has stressed that any talks with Pyongyang should address the issue of the regime's nuclear arsenal. The North, however, has consistently stated that its nuclear weapons guarantee its national security and are not negotiable.

"But I also believe it speaks strongly to the effect that international sanctions are having on the regime," he added. "If there had been no sanctions, I do not believe Kim would have started this detente with his New Year's speech and all the moves that we have seen since surrounding the Winter Olympics and now the face-to-face meetings." Referring to the five soldiers who defected across the Demilitarized Zone in the last few months, Rah added, "If they cannot feed their front-line troops, then the problems that the rest of the country are facing must be very serious." And while the US will be closely watching the North-South discussions, Rah said Washington is unlikely to budge from its basic demand that North Korea do away with its nuclear arsenal. In early June 2017, North Korea test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the first time. Testing an ICBM marked a major military achievement for Pyongyang and a serious escalation of tensions with the United States and its allies in the region, particularly South Korea and Japan. At the time, defense experts said the ICBM could reach as far as the US states of Alaska and Hawaii. However, it was unclear if North Korea can field an ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear warhead on its cone that could survive reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. North Korean state media claimed the ICBM was capable of carrying a "large, heavy nuclear warhead" to any part of the United States. The ICBM is believed to be a step forward in the North's nuclear program. Despite pressure from the international community, Pyongyang has made no secret of its nuclear ambitions. Alongside its ritual ballistic missile tests, North Korea has conducted nuclear tests on at least six occasions, including one in September 2017. Responding to the first ICBM test with a show of force, the US and South Korean troops on conducted "deep strike" precision missile drills using Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and the Republic of Korea's Hyunmoo Missile II. In April, the US sent its Carl Vinson aircraft carrier towards the Korean Peninsula, saying it was taking prudent measures against the North. Ignoring international condemnation, Pyongyang test-launched another rocket on July 28, 2017, just weeks after its first ICBM test. In both of the tests, North Korea used Hwasong-14 missile, but the second one reached a higher altitude and traveled a larger distance than the first one, according to the state media. Pyongyang conducted its third test November 29, using a newly developed Hwasong-15 missile. US, Japanese and South Korean officials said it rose to about 4,500 km (2,800 miles) and flew 960 kilometers (600 miles) over about 50 minutes before landing in Japan's exclusive economic zone off the country's coast. Apart from a developing missile and nuclear program, North Korea has a powerful army with 700,000 active troops and another 4.5 million in the reserves. It can call upon almost a quarter of its population to serve in the army at any given time. The North's bloated army is believed to outnumber its southern neighbor's by two-to-one. According to the 2017 Global Firepower Index, the North has, as part of a far-reaching arsenal, 458 fighter aircraft, 5,025 combat tanks, 76 submarines, and 5,200,000 total military personnel. The picture above from 2013 shows leader Kim Jong Un ordering strategic rocket forces to be on standby to strike US and South Korean targets at any time. Alongside the United States, Pyongyang views its neighbors South Korea and Japan as its two other main enemies. North Korea has used US military exercises in the region as means of galvanizing its people, claiming that the exercises are dress rehearsals for an impending invasion. Every year, hundreds of thousands of soldiers and citizens roll through the streets of the capital Pyongyang to take part in the North's military parades. Preparations for the rallies often begin months in advance, and the parades usually mark important anniversaries linked with the Communist Party or Kim Jong Un's family. US favors sanctions "The US is happy to continue applying sanctions because they can see that they are working. They have forced the North to the discussion table already and this leverage over the regime there is only going to grow over time," he said. Given the dire situation in the North, Rah expects the regime to eventually concede to the US' demands in exchange for talks, although he offered a word of caution. "We must remember that we have been here before and that North Korea has broken its promises in the past. They may agree to abolish their nuclear weapons, but the problem will be whether they actually will." Daniel Pinkston, a professor of international relations at the Seoul campus of Troy University, says there are many positives that could come out of a meeting between Moon and Kim, but he also warns that North Korea's fundamental ambition of controlling the whole of the Korean Peninsula has not changed. "Anything that results in eliminating or reducing the likelihood of kinetic attacks or violence on the peninsula will be a good thing," he told DW. "But it appears that we are headed into another cycle in which the North portrays itself as a reasonable, pluralistic, democratic regime that is ready to communicate and cooperate with the outside world before they revert to the principles of a proletariat dictatorship."

Pinkston added that Moon wants to create the conditions that would allow the North to return to talks on their nuclear weapons, but the North has to bargain in good faith and meet its international commitments. "We can only wait and see quite how far they are willing to go." There are some in South Korea who have little faith that the North has changed its tune and is ready to rejoin the international community. For conservatives, Moon is risking the nation's security by negotiating with a regime that is still bent on dominating the South. On Sunday, Hong Joon-pyo, the head of the Liberty Korea Party, posted a message on his Facebook page comparing Moon's policy of engagement towards the North to that of former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasing Adolf Hitler ahead of Nazi Germany's invasion and occupation of the nations of Eastern Europe in the late 1930s. "The Moon Jae-in government's policy of begging North Korea for dialogue and talks about special envoys are similar to Chamberlain's policy of appeasement towards Germany and will end up helping the North to buy time to complete its nuclear weapons," Hoon wrote.
