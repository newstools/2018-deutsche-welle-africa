South African chief prosecutor Shaun Abrahams on Friday announced his decision to reinstate corruption charges against former President Jacob Zuma. The charges concern a 30-billion-rand (€2 billion, $2.5 billion) arms deal in the late 1990s, Abrahams said. "After consideration of the matter, there are reasonable prospects of a successful prosecution of Mr. Zuma," Abrahams told a press conference. "A trial court would be the most appropriate [venue] for the ventilation of the issues." Zuma, 75, was forced to resign by his ruling African National Congress (ANC) last month. He now faces racketeering, corruption, money laundering and fraud charges, all of which can carry lengthy custodial sentences.

The case also included those in Zuma's inner-circle. His former financial advisor, Schabir Shaik, was convicted in 2015 for facilitating the bribes. He was sentenced to 15 years for his involvement. According to prosecutors, Zuma and fellow officials received some €4.2 billion ($5 billion) in kickbacks. Zuma has denied any involvement. How politicians in South Africa have reacted: Zuma's ANC acknowledged the NPA's decision and said it had confidence in the criminal justice system. "We continue to assert the inalienable right of all in our country, including Comrade Jacob Zuma, to be presumed innocent until and if proven guilty," the party said in a statement. Mmusi Maimane, the head of the opposition Democratic Alliance, described it as "a victory for all who have fought for years for Jacob Zuma to face accountability for his crimes. That accountability starts now."
