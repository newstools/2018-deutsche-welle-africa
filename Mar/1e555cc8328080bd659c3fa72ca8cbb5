"Germany bears the responsibility for the most barbarous crime in the history of humanity," Maas wrote in the visitors' book at the Yad Vashem memorial. "The Shoah (the Hebrew term for the Holocaust) remains a warning and duty to us to campaign for human rights and tolerance worldwide. We stand by the country that remembers everyone here in Yad Vashem whose lives and dreams were destroyed."

During the handover ceremony at the Foreign Ministry in Berlin, where he took over the reins from Sigmar Gabriel, Maas stressed that "it's because of Auschwitz that I chose to go into politics."
