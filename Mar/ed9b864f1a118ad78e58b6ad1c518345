Doctors who carried out Tuesday's autopsy on the late Italian soccer player Davide Astori were quoted by news agency ANSA as saying the Fiorentina captain's death "possibly had a bradycardic origin." Bradycardic is defined as a slow heartbeat rate, usually under 60 beats per minute in adults. Prosecutor Antonio De Nicolo later went on Italian television to say that Astori had died a natural death, adding that further details would be made public once tissue analysis had been completed in around 60 days. The autopsy findings should bring to a close the prosecution's investigation into whether Astori's death was caused by manslaughter. Astori was found dead in his hotel room on Sunday ahead of Fiorentina's Serie A match at Udinese. He was 31 years old. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

Florence mayor Dario Nardella has also invited the city to observe a minute's silence at 1 p.m. local time (1200 UTC). In a tribute to Astori, both Fiorentina and his former club Cagliari announced they would retire the number 13 jersey, which the defender donned for both teams. "In honor of Davide #Astori's memory, @CagliariCalcio and #ACFFiorentina have decided to retire the No. 13 shirt. #DA13," Fiorentina said on the club's Twitter account. Astori made 289 Serie A appearances over 10 seasons and won 14 caps for the Italian national team.
