The Kenyan part of Moyale town is staring at a possible humanitarian crisis. The town straddles the porous Ethiopian-Kenyan border and the number of refugees fleeing a military operation in Ethiopia is rising by the hour. Education has been crippled in the Kenyan town as schools closed down to host the asylum seekers. Some people are nursing gunshot wounds and humanitarian agencies are calling for urgent assistance.

Public health officer Sacha Tacho describes the situation: "We have another very sick patient in the ward, with a bullet in the neck, the bullet is still in the neck and we cannot remove it here in Moyale." Solomon Gubo, the Deputy Governor of Moyale County, says that they are helping the refugees to settle in, but it is proving to be a challenge especially due to the heavy rains and insufficient humanitarian assistance. "There is no housing, there is no food; that is the challenge we are facing as of now," says Gubo.

The government in Addis Ababa had announced the deployment of soldiers to the Moyale area, saying that they were pursuing fighters of the Oromo Liberation Front, which the government has banned as a terrorist group. According to the government-run Ethiopian News Agency, some soldiers then launched an attack based on a faulty intelligence report. The forces reportedly killed at least nine people and injured 12. The government has said it has now disarmed five of the officers involved and declared that they would now face an investigation and military court. Government explanation 'not acceptable' Speaking to DW earlier this week, Taye Dendea, spokesperson of the state-run Oromia Justice Bureau, condemned the government's actions. "After killing unarmed people in broad daylight, trying to argue that it happened due to wrong information is not acceptable," Dendea told DW. "This is a premeditated crime and it is also a war crime against the people. Firing a machine gun at people in their house, daily laborers on the street, people trading in their shops and people eating at restaurant is totally unacceptable. This did not happen based on wrong information. Saying this itself is an insult to the people. Even some of them were told to kneel and were shot on the spot." DW has confirmed that on Thursday Dendea was detained for questioning. Following the Oromo protests in 2016, people held vigils to remember protesters who had died Residents flee unexplained crackdown Since the event, residents of the Ethiopian part of the town have been pouring into Kenya. On Thursday at least 100 people held protests in the Kenyan town against the Ethiopian government. Sam Gurale, who crossed over from Ethiopia, told the Red Cross what he experienced. "I was in my house when I heard loud gunshots, we ran towards the main road. We found dead bodies all over the road and they were not killed by bandits. It is the Ethiopian government that is killing us. So we ran for our lives."

"Because of the state of emergency, the government is becoming more authoritarian. How do we feel? No democracy, no rights, some of those killed are children, a 12-year-old boy, old people, and farmers, teachers, even a headmaster has been killed," he said. Although there it are no clear details about what actually happened and who the the attack was aimed at, most of those who fled claim that they were innocent. "Those who were attacked by the military were ordinary business people. Some were selling khat (a plant-based stimulant drug native to the Horn of Africa that is legal in Ethiopia). Others were in their shops going about their businesses," said Mohammed Buru, who had also crossed the border. Oromo crisis continues The crisis around Ethiopia's largest region, Oromiya, has been going on for the past few years. Anti-government protests have rocked the region and a ten-month state of emergency was only lifted in August 2017. In February 2018 Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned and the state of emergency was reinstated. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

"The 'Masterplan' was the trigger. But public grievances go back more than two decades," explains Merga Bula of DW's Amharic service. "The grievances include respect for human rights, equal employment opportunities at private institutions and government agencies, and democratic rights — the right to freedom of speech, the right to assembly. And the political space has been tightened since this government came to power." At the start of the year, the government released thousands of political prisoners and detained protesters. Since the state of emergency was reinstated, hundreds of people have been detained once again. The area around Moyale has always had a strong military presence, but as Bula explains, Moyale has not seen as many protests as other towns in Oromiya. The government crackdown and resulting humanitarian crisis could, however, make the town a new political hotspot. "This problem is not only limited to Moyale town, but also other villages surrounding the town," admits Aschalew Yohanis, mayor of the Ethiopian part of Moyale town. DW's Merga Bula also contributed to this report. "It took us four days traveling from Asmara," a 31-year-old Eritrean man says about the trek from the Eritrean capital, 80 kilometres north of the border, after arriving in Ethiopia. "We travelled for 10 hours each night, sleeping in the desert during the day." With him are another three men, three women, six girls and four small boys. "Living conditions in Eritrea are more dangerous than crossing the border," says a 39-year-old Eritrean soldier - now a deserter after crossing into Ethiopia - who served 20 years in the military. After being collected by Ethiopian soldiers patrolling the border, Eritreans are sent to a registration center to begin the process to claim asylum in Ethiopia. New arrivals are allocated to one of four refugee camps in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. The Hitsats camp is the newest and largest, sheltering around 11,000 refugees, with 80 percent under 35 years of age. "Even if they are seeking political asylum, there will be an economic side to it as they are young and need to generate income to live their lives," says camp coordinator Haftam Telemickael. The camp’s infrastructure is simple but neat. There’s little rubbish lying around, and people make their accommodation feel as homely as possible. "When I drink a cup of coffee among the flowers it feels good," says John, 40, standing in the small garden full of flowers around his Hitsats camp home that he shares with his 10-year-old daughter. His wife is in America. "The Eritrean people are good," says Luel Abera, an Ethiopian official who helps coordinate refugee arrivals before they move to a camp. "They fought for independence for 30 years. But from day one, [Eritrean President] Isaias [Afwerki] has ruled the country without caring about his people’s interests." Isaias has ruled Eritrea for more than 25 years. "I don’t want to talk about why we crossed," says 18-year-old Haimanot who runs a small shack in Hitsats that recharges mobiles for one Ethiopian birr (0.04 euro) a charge. In February 2017, 3,367 Eritrean refugees arrived in Ethiopia, according to Ethiopia’s refugee agency. Around 165,000 Eritrean refugees and asylum seekers reside in Ethiopia, according to the UN. "In Sudan there are more problems, we can sleep peacefully here," says Ariam, 32, who came to Hitsat four years ago with her two children after spending four years in a refugee camp in Sudan. Refugees claim the Eritrean military conducts raids in Sudan to capture Eritreans. Ethiopia’s border with Eritrea is much more heavily guarded against incursions. "Ethiopia's response is to manage the gate, and figure out how it can benefit from these inevitable flows of people," says refugee analyst Jennifer Riggan. More money is also spent hosting refugees nowadays due to international efforts to stop secondary migration to Europe. It may also be a way for Ethiopia to bolster its international reputation after controversy about recent protests. Military positions from the 1998-2000 war between Ethiopia and Eritrea still stand alongside today’s border. All the while both governments accuse one of plotting against the other. But Ethiopia appears willing to differentiate with ordinary Eritreans. "We are the same people, we share the same blood, even the same grandfathers," says Estifanos Gebremedhin with Ethiopia’s refugee agency. "My children are in America but there is no point my going—I am an old man now," says 74-year-old Tesfaye in Shimelba, Tigray’s first Eritrean refugee camp which opened in 2004. Thousands more Eritreans live in Ethiopias cities outside the camps. Many others decide to leave Ethiopia and migrate onward, some legally, like Tesfaye’s children, many more illegally, often dying trying. "The Ethiopian soldiers who found us were like brothers to us," says 22-year-old mother-of-two Yordanos. Eritrea was Ethiopia's most northern region before a referendum officially giving it independence in 1993 made Tigray the most northern. Hence many Eritreans who cross the border share the same language, Tigrinya, and the same Orthodox religion and culture as Tigray’s inhabitants. Author: James Jeffrey (im)
