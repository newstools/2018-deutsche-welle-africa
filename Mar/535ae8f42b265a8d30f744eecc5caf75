We'll begin this hour with the piece by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart nicknamed the "Kegelstatt," a word used in Vienna for a kind of bowling alley. Mozart loved to get together with friends for that activity, and anecdote has it that this Trio in E-flat somehow came to him in the summer of 1786 while bowling. The "Lost Generation" is what people sometimes call the soldiers and victims of World War One. One of them was the composer Rudi Stephan, who as a private in the German Army hoped for a "speedy end to the terrible war." It's a tragedy that for him, it really was a speedy end: in 1915 he died on the eastern front, age 28. Composer Rudi Stephan Rudi Stephan's Music for Seven String Instruments, written when he was 24, is praised by violinist Florian Donderer for its "strong, powerful, uncompromising musical style. Seemingly portending things to come, it's also nostalgic - and very personal, a piece that deserves to be heard." The motto of the most recent edition of the festival named "Tensions" was "Mostly Dvořák." Everyone we talked to there was a fan of the composer, including pianist Herbert Schuch, who told DW, "With Dvořák, the music is so great that when you're playing it, you forget all the difficulties or risky parts because you're so enthused. There's so much substance in it, you just have to play it."
