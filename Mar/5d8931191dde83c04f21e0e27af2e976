The German football association (DFB) announced on Tuesday that it had decided to part company with Steffi Jones, who had taken over as coach of the women's national team following the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. A DFB statement said that the members of its presidential board had taken the decision following an analysis of the team's performance over the past several months. Horst Hrubesch is to take over as head coach of the women's team on an interim basis, starting with next month's Women's World Cup qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Slovenia. More to follow.
