His wife was killed in the attack after being shot in the head at close range, Reuters news agency quoted a police source as saying. In a video posted on YouTube in December 2010, Namazov said he was jailed in Azerbaijan after he wrote stories about brutality against soldiers in units of the Azeri military. He said he spent six months in solitary confinement. Azerbaijan is ranked at No. 162 out of 180 countries on the Reporters Without Borders 2017 Press Freedom Index.

"You can't help but think this was a settling of scores," Michelet-Traval said in comments to French newspaper La Depeche.

"It will be up to investigators to shed light on this dramatic case that occurred in Colomiers, but it could have taken place anywhere in France," she said. Journalists threatened Human Rights Watch said last year that the Azeri government continued its crackdown on dissenting voices and that reports of torture persisted. It also said independent media outlets faced harassment and closure, and journalists who were critical of the government faced threats and intimidation to silence them. The investigation is being handled by the Toulouse judicial police. law/sms (AFP, Reuters)
