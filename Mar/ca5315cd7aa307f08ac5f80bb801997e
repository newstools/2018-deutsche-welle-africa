Sally Davies, England's chief medical officer, said Sunday that traces of a nerve agent used in an attack on Sergei Skripal were discovered in a pub and restaurant the Russian ex-spy had visited with his 33-year-old daughter. Davies said up to 500 people who had visited The Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant were asked to wash their clothes and other belongings as a precaution. British authorities are treating the March 4 attack on Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia as attempted murder. The two remain in a critical condition in the hospital. "There has been some trace contamination by the nerve agent in both The Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury," Davies said. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

However, some people are concerned long-term exposure to these substances may, over weeks and particularly months, give rise to health problems," she added. Davies went on to advise guests to the pub or restaurant to wash the clothes and possessions they wore or carried while in the establishments.

He is still hospitalized, but he has recovered enough to sit up and engage with his family, according to British Home Secretary Amber Rudd. Over 250 members of the UK counterterrorism police were working on the investigation into the poisoning of the Russia-born double agent Skripal. The probe was proceeding with "speed and professionalism," according to Rudd. Read more: Spy assassinations: The top five deadly poisons Russian involvement?

The UK government deployed around 180 soldiers, including chemical warfare experts, to various locations around Salisbury. A local restaurant and a pub remain closed, and forensic teams were collecting evidence from Skripal's home. Many have speculated that Russia was behind the poisoning of Skripal, who served as an officer of the Russian military intelligence service in the mid-1990s when he was recruited by British MI6 spies.

However, he was delivered to the UK in 2010 after a spy swap. British papers reported that the London government was mulling over retaliatory measures against Russia in case the theory of Moscow's involvement is confirmed. UK Prime Minister Theresa May could announce sanctions "as soon as Monday," according to the Daily Telegraph. Sergei Skripal, a 66-year-old former Russian spy, was found unconscious on a bench outside a shopping center in the British city of Salisbury after he was exposed to what police said was an unknown substance. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the situation "tragic" but said, "We don't have information about what could be the cause, what this person did." The estranged half-brother of Kim Jong Un was killed on February 13, 2018 at Kuala Lumpur airport after two women allegedly smeared the chemical nerve agent VX on his face. In February, a Malaysian court heard that Kim Jong Nam had been carrying a dozen vials of antidote for the deadly nerve agent VX in his backpack at the time of the poisoning. Former Russian spy Litvinenko had worked for the Federal Security Service (FSB) before he defected to Britain, where he became a journalist and wrote two books of accusations against the FSB and Putin. He became ill after meeting with two former KGB officers and died on November 23, 2006. A government inquiry found he was killed by radioactive polonium-210 which it alleged the men put in his tea. In November 2010, doctors at Berlin's Charité hospital discovered high levels of mercury had been found in a Russian dissident couple working in Berlin. Kalashnikov, a freelance journalist and former KGB colonel, had 3.7 micrograms of mercury per litre of blood, while his wife had 56 micrograms. A safe level is 1-3 micrograms. Viktor reportedly told German magazine Focus that "Moscow poisoned us." Ukrainian opposition leader Yushchenko became sick in September 2004 and was diagnosed with acute pancreatis caused by a viral infection and chemical substances. The illness resulted in facial disfigurement, with pockmarks, bloating and jaundice. Doctors said the changes to his face were from chloracne, which is a result of dioxin poisoning. Yushchenko claimed government agents poisoned him. On September 25, 1997, Israel's intelligence agency attempted to assassinate Hamas leader Meshaal, under orders from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Two agents sprayed a poisonous substance into Meshaal's ear as he walked into the Hamas offices in Amman, Jordan. The assassination attempt was unsuccessful and not long afterward the two Israeli agents were captured. In 1978, Bulgarian dissident Markov was waiting at a bus stop after a shift at the BBC when he felt a sharp jab in his thigh. He turned to see a man picking up an umbrella. A small bump appeared where he felt the jab and four days later he died. An autopsy found he'd been killed by a small pellet containing a 0.2-milligram dose of ricin. Many believe the poisoned dart was fired from the umbrella. On December 30, 1916, mystic and spiritual healer Rasputin arrived at Yusupov Palace in St Petersburg at the invitation Prince Felix Yusupov. There, Prince Yusupov offered Rasputin cakes laced with potassium cyanide but he just kept eating them. Yusupov then gave him wine in a cyanide-laced wine glasses, but still Rasputin continued to drink. With the poison failing, Rasputin was shot and killed.
