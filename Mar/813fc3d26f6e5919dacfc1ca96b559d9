Syrian government forces on Saturday marched between Douma and Harasta, the two largest towns in rebel-held eastern Ghouta, cutting them off from the rest of the region and effectively splitting the enclave into three parts. "Regime forces have divided eastern Ghouta into three parts — Douma and its surroundings, Harasta in the west, and the rest of the towns further south," the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitor, said.

Government troops launched a ferocious assault on eastern Ghouta, the last rebel-held area near the capital of Damascus, on February 18 and have now overrun more than half of the region. Two main Islamist rebel groups remain present in eastern Ghouta, Jaish al-Islam and Failaq al-Rahman, as do a small number of militants from the Nusra Front, al-Qaida's former Syrian arm. The military's indiscriminate three-week assault on the region has seen around 1,000 civilians killed, more than a quarter of which have been children, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Hundreds more people have been injured. Read more: Which rebel groups are fighting in Syria's eastern Ghouta? The UN estimated that some 400,000 people remain trapped in the enclave, which has been under rebel control since 2013. Despite UN calls for a temporary ceasefire across Syria, the government of President Bashar al-Assad has maintained that the bombing campaign is necessary to root out Islamist militants from area. Evacuation deals begin The onslaught follows the pattern of previous offensives launched by Assad's regime on rebel-held regions, by deploying relentless shelling and air power in a bid to force opposition insurgents into an evacuation agreement. Late on Friday, a small number of fighters for the Nusra Front were allowed to leave eastern Ghouta with their families under such a deal. Syrian state television aired footage of a single bus carrying 13 "fighters" out of the area, without naming their affiliation. More than 500 people have been killed so far in one of the most ferocious attacks on eastern Ghouta near Damascus since the conflict began in 2011. President Bashar Assad's forces continued their assault on eastern Ghouta despite a UN resolution demanding a 30-day ceasefire, as well as a five-hour daily "pause" ordered by President Vladimir Putin, the Syrian regime's main ally. Referring to the Syrian regime's latest assault, which began on February 19, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres demanded "this hell on earth" be stopped immediately. Eastern Ghouta is one of the last rebel strongholds and is home to about 400,000 people, most of whom have been unable to flee. Damascus wants to gain territory, with the help of Russia, to secure its interests during peace talks. According to activists and doctors in the region, several people have suffered symptoms consistent with those triggered by a chlorine gas attack and had to be treated in hospital. French President Emmanuel Macron has warned the Syrian regime that the use of chemical weapons will result in French retaliation, but the Syrian government claims it has never used this kind of munition.

More than 300,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in 2011, when the government cracked down on protesters who were calling for the release of political prisoners and for President Bashar Assad to step down. Activists say people in Douma have little food or water. Marten Mylius, the emergency relief coordinator for CARE in the Middle East, told DW that "after the tunnels were destroyed and the crossings closed, the price of basic foods skyrocketed. One kilo of rice now costs $4.50 (€3.66). A lot of people cannot afford that anymore. In other words, we are witnessing a rapid spread of malnutrition." Aid access to eastern Ghouta is difficult because there is no direct route from neighboring countries. "In Idlib, for example...you can get in directly from the Turkish border. You can wait with supplies at the border and then bring in the convoy. It is much more difficult in eastern Ghouta because we have to negotiate with the Syrian regime and are at the mercy of its decisions," Mylius told DW. The UN Security Council unanimously demanded a 30-day ceasefire in Syria "without delay" on February 24. Drafted by Kuwait and Sweden, the resolution proposed a 30-day pause in fighting across the country to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered and people in need of emergency medical assistance to be evacuated. Russia insisted that the text not apply to the "Islamic State" group or al-Qaida. Author: Nicole Goebel Brief relief after days of food shortages On Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported that 13 trucks loaded with supplies had reached some 12,000 people in eastern Ghouta, before they were forced to pull out when shelling resumed. Aid groups have been attempting to deliver food and medical aid to the besieged region since Monday but have only been able to deliver a small portion during the designated daily five-hour ceasefire. Agencies claim that the window is too short to allow sufficient aid to enter the besieged region, while there have also been reports of rebels targeting the convoys. UN agencies have also accused Syrian military forces of stripping convoy trucks of medical supplies.
