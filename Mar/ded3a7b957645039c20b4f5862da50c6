German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier underlined the importance of Germany's economic and political ties with India as he met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Saturday.

Steinmeier's remarks came as he began what appeared to be the business-end of his five-day India trip, which started on Thursday with a series of visits to various traditional and religious sites. Some 1,800 German firms employ more than 400,000 people in India. Germany is India's largest trading partner in the European Union and sixth largest overall. Bilateral trade between the two countries totaled some $19 billion (€15.4 billion) in 2016-17. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

According to the president, Modi criticized the US' protectionist trade measures during their talks, adding that President Donald Trump's talks of a trade war risked undermining progress made on behalf of the World Trade Organization. Modi's position on trade was a good signal "that I will be taking home with me," Steinmeier said. "In a world where talk is often of 'everyone versus everyone,' we can rely on India as a partner who is committed to an international order based on mutual respect and rules," he added.

"Our bilateral cooperation must look at how we can contribute to global issues, for example when it comes to protecting the environment," Steinmeier said, adding that these issues were particularly pressing at a time when they are "being ignored by others," a nod to the US.

India has made its desire to move ever faster towards renewable energy sources well-known. Earlier this month, Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron kick-started the International Solar Alliance (ISA) during a summit in New Delhi. Some 120 nations have signed up to the Indo-French-led initiative with the shared ambition of reducing costs of solar energy and future environmental technologies.
