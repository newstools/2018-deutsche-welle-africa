Polish lawmakers from the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party welcomed what appeared to be the first case filed under Poland's new so-called "Holocaust bill" — a new legislation making it illegal to suggest Poland was complicit in the murder of Jews during World War II. The Polish League Against Defamation, a non-governmental group that campaigns to protect Poland's reputation abroad, said it filed a complaint against Argentine daily Pagina 12 on Friday, the day after the new law came into effect.

implementation The newspaper's website was accused of using a picture of Polish so-called "doomed soldiers" in an article on the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom, where Poles are alleged to have collaborated with Nazi occupiers in the massacre of some 350 Jews. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

The anti-communist doomed soldiers are widely regarded as national heroes in Poland for standing up against Soviet domination. However, records appear to show that some of them also led the killing of Jews, Belarusians 
and  other minorities. Argentine daily accuses Poland of 'international censorship' Pagina 12 published an article on its website on Saturday evening stating that it had not received "any legal communication and only learned of the information through international news agency reports." "If successful, this attempt at international censorship could threaten freedom of expression worldwide," the article continued.

"The organization has a right to submit such a notice," Wojcik told Polish broadcaster Zet. "If the court decides the complaint is admissible — and it should do so — then there will be a court case."

Under the law, anyone found guilty of ascribing "responsibility or co-responsibility to the Polish nation or state for crimes committed by the German Third Reich" could face up to three years in prison. PiS Lawmakers say the bill aims to protect Poland from slander. However, critics have warned that it risks skewing historic research and suppressing free speech.

The law has opened up an unprecedented diplomatic row between the two countries. While thousands of Poles risked their lives to protect the country's Jewish population from Nazi occupation forces during the war, research published since the collapse of communism has questioned national narratives. Roughly half of the 6 million Jews murdered during the Holocaust lived in pre-war Poland. Around 3 million non-Jews died also died during Nazi Germany's six-year occupation of Poland.
