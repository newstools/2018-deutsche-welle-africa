In apparent justification of his controversial decision on Thursday to impose new tariffs, US President Donald Trump read off tweets by the Tesla CEO that called on the president to challenge China's stiff import duties on cars. Elon Musk noted that China was charging a 25 percent import duty on cars — ten times the 2.5 percent levy the US puts on China-built vehicles. Musk also said he was "against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It's like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes." The company had raised the issue with the prior US administration, Musk added, but nothing had happened. All Tesla wanted was a fair outcome, "ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate."

"No US auto company is allowed to own even 50 percent of their own factory in China, but there are five 100 percent China-owned EV [electric vehicle] auto companies in the US," Musk wrote in another tweet. Trump was quick to lap up the criticism, saying that US politicians had known this for years but did nothing. "It's got to change," he said as he signed his executive order on the new steel tariffs on Thursday. He added that he planned to charge other countries "mirror taxes" for what American products face. Rules change ahead? Import duties and the difficulties Tesla has had avoiding them by trying to produce in China has held the company back in the world's biggest market for cleaner cars.

The National Development and Reform Commission said in June 2016 that China was looking into lifting the cap on foreign ownership. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
