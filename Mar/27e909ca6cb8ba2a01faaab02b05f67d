Germany and other members of the G20 group of major economies warned against protectionism at a G20 meeting in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires on Monday, as US trading partners prepare for planned US tariffs on steel and aluminum. "We must make sure that protectionism will not now define the global landscape, but that there will still be open markets," German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters. He added that he expected the final communique to emphasize the importance of free trade.

He added that a trade war would harm global growth: "It is clear that such an escalation would only create losers in the end." Read more: Does Donald Trump eye a weak dollar?

The measures — a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports — are set to enter force on Friday. Only Canada and Mexico have been granted exemptions. But EU leaders have called on the US to exempt the bloc as well, with French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire asking Mnuchin for an exemption during the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires. "To tell you the bottom line, no one would understand if the EU, at the end of the day, is not globally exempt from this," he said. The EU has already warned it will retaliate if it is not exempted by slapping tariffs on US exports, including motorcycles and whisky.
