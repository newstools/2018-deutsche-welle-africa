South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Wednesday said it was "too early to be optimistic" about denuclearization discussions between North Korea and the United States. "We are only at the starting line," Moon said after a meeting with political party leaders. During a landmark meeting between South Korean officials and Kim Jong Un on Monday, the North Korean leader expressed his intention to denuclearize the Korean peninsula if the North's security was guaranteed. In April, North and South Korea will hold the first talks between the two countries' leaders since 2007.

"We cannot have things like the prevention of nuclear proliferation or a moratorium as a final goal," he said. No 'presents for the North' But Moon reiterated that South Korea would not be easing sanctions against North Korea to facilitate a summit with Pyongyang. "The president said just because talks have begun doesn't mean sanctions pressure will be eased or lifted. There will not be any 'presents' for the North, either," Shin Yong-hyun of opposition party Bareun Mirae quoted Moon as saying. Read more: Guns, gold and gas. What UN sanctions target North Korea? In August 2017, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution banning all coal, iron, iron ore and lead imports from North Korea. Pictured here is China's Liaoning Greenland Energy Coal Co. in Dandong, on the border with North Korea. North Korea is prohibited from opening banks abroad, and UN member states are prohibited from operating financial institutions on Pyongyang's behalf. Any dealings that might help North Korea skirt the sanctions are banned, and UN member states must expel and repatriate anyone working on the regime's financial behalf. This North Korean cargo ship found itself boarded for inspection in the Philippines in March 2016 after the United Nations ordered member nations to de-register any vessel owned, operated or crewed on orders from Pyongyang. North Korean ships also cannot fly the flags of other nations to evade sanctions. Air Koryo, North Korea's national carrier, remains exempt from aviation sanctions and still has scheduled flights to China and Russia, as well as several domestic routes. However, the airline cannot fly to the European Union, which has banned it on safety grounds, and the United States prevents citizens from legally conducting business with the carrier. In December 2017, a new raft of UN sanctions targeted fuel imports in North Korea, meaning its residents could have difficulties driving the country in Pyeonghwa sedans (pictured above). The sale and transfer of diesel and kerosene are limited while the import of crude oil is capped at 4 million barrels a year. UN sanctions limit North Korea's diplomats abroad — at the country's Berlin embassy, for example — to only one bank account each. North Korea is also not permitted to own real estate abroad for any purposes other than consular. It's a safe bet that North Korea's marching military did not learn its moves abroad: UN sanctions ban foreign security forces from training the country's army, police or paramilitary units. The United Nations does permit medical exchanges, but otherwise allow very little assistance of scientific or technical value. Anyone wanting to own a larger-than-life Kim will have to await the end of North Korea's nuclear program. The UN sanctions currently ban the sale of statues by the nation. North Korea is 'sincere' The South Korean president said that he believed US President Donald Trump was "positive about the results of the North Korea visit" from what he had seen in the news and on social media. "I really believe they are sincere," Trump said at a White House news conference on Tuesday.

"Maybe this is a breakthrough. I seriously doubt it," Coats said at a Senate hearing. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

South Korea's presidential national security director, Chung Eui-yong, said he had a message from Kim Jong Un that he would deliver to the US. After the US trip, Chung is due to visit China and Russia, while Suh Hoon, the head of South Korea's intelligence agency, will go to Japan to brief officials on the talks with North Korea. law/rt (AFP, dpa, Reuters)
