The European planemaker said Wednesday up to 3,700 positions in France, Germany, Britain and Spain would be impacted by a cut in the production rates for the two aircraft, but without saying whether the posts were being cut or moved elsewhere.

In a statement, the company said it was committed to managing the workforce reduction in "a responsible manner." "The company is confident that it will be able to propose opportunities to most of the affected employees through programmes which are ramping up," it added. Following a meeting with company executives, the biggest trade union representing Airbus staff, Force Ouvriere, said management wanted to slash 3,720 jobs while avoiding outright redundancies. "At no moment was there any discussion of outright layoffs," union leader Jean-Marc Escourrou said, adding that temporary jobs and subcontractors would be the first to go.

Seven countries are involved: Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey. However, it's been facing delays and cost overruns, forcing Airbus to take a charge of €1.3 billion on the A400M last year.

In January, Airbus already had warned it would have to halt production of the A380 altogether unless it received new orders. Emirates Airlines — already the biggest customer for the A380 with 101 in its fleet and 41 more on order — threw it a lifeline days later by striking a $16-billion deal to buy 36 more of the jets.
