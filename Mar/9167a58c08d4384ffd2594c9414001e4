The World Happiness Report, released Wednesday, crowned Finland the happiest place to live out of 156 countries.

Germany came in at number 15, ahead of the United States (18th) and the United Kingdom (19th). The unhappiest countries were Burundi, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Tanzania and Yemen.

And again, Finland — home to around 300,000 foreigners — came out on top. "The most striking finding of the report is the remarkable consistency between the happiness of immigrants and the locally born," said John Helliwell, co-editor of the report and a professor at the University of British Columbia.

But that trend didn't necessarily continue down the list. Germany, which saw hundreds of thousands of arrivals during the 2015-16 migrant crisis, only ranked 28th in terms of immigrant happiness.

Last year's winner was Norway. In 2016, Denmark took the top spot. Meik Wiking, CEO of the Copenhagen-based Happiness Research Institute, said the happiness revealed in the survey stems from healthy amounts of both personal freedoms and social security that outweigh residents having to pay "some of the highest taxes in the world."

According to Jeffrey Sachs, a leading US development economist who contributed to the report, "the US happiness ranking is falling, in part because of the ongoing epidemics of obesity, substance abuse, and untreated depression." Wiking from the Happiness Research Institute said the US had also seen declining "trust, generosity and social support, and those are some of the factors that explain why some countries are happier than others."
