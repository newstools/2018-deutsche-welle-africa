Pedro Kuczynski announced his resignation on Wednesday Last-minute resignation Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker, resigned after the publication of secretly shot videos showing his associates allegedly trying to bribe opposition lawmakers to block Kuczynski's impeachment. The impeachment vote had been set for Thursday. The vote itself was the culmination of a months-long campaign by the opposition to oust the 79-year-old Kuczynski over his previous ties to Brazilian construction company Odebrecht. Odebrecht admitted in December to paying Kuczynski's consulting firms nearly $5 million (€4 million) while he was a government minister in the mid-2000s. Odebrecht has also admitted to conducting an $800 million scheme to bribe officials in 12 countries, 10 of them in Latin America.
