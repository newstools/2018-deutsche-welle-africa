Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was on Tuesday summoned by a British parliamentary committee to explain how UK-based Cambridge Analytica managed to harvest the personal data of Facebook users. Facebook is under fire after reports that Cambridge Analytica misused information from more than 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. The social network has lost billions of dollars in market value since Monday. In a letter addressed to Zuckerberg, Damian Collins, the chairman of the UK parliamentary media committee, said he has repeatedly asked Facebook how it uses data. He accused the social media giant of "misleading" the committee by "consistently understating" the risks surrounding data protection.

"It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process," Collins said in the note. "Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to 'fixing' Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you." The request to appear comes as British data protection authority was seeking a warrant to search the London offices of Cambridge Analytica. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

"We've invited Mark Zuckerberg to the European Parliament," the body's president, Antonio Tajani, tweeted. "Facebook needs to clarify before the representatives of 500 million Europeans that personal data is not being used to manipulate democracy."
