Syrian government troops and rebel forces clashed on multiple fronts in eastern Ghouta on Sunday, a day after the military effectively splintered the rebel-held enclave into three parts and isolated the region's largest town of Douma. The regime's divide-and-conquer strategy saw troops cut off the road linking Douma with the enclave's largest town, Harasta.

More than 4,000 more have been wounded. The military's devastating advance, backed by Russian air power, has attracted international condemnation. However, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has insisted the campaign is necessary to root out Islamist terrorists from the region. The besieged areas' two main rebel groups, Failaq al-Rahman and Jaish al-Islam, have vowed to resist the Syrian army's offensive, despite having lost more than half of eastern Ghouta's territory to the Syrian regime in just under three weeks of heavy combat. Meanwhile, aid agencies have struggled to deliver food and medical supplies to the roughly 400,000 people still living in the region.

Hammuriyeh delegation plans evacuation deals Reports on Sunday suggested that a committee from the opposition-held eastern Ghouta town of Hammuriyeh had met with regime officials to negotiate an evacuation deal. "The committee discussed a proposed reconciliation that would guarantee exit for those that want to leave, both civilians and rebels, from Hammuriyeh to other areas in Syria under rebel control," a member from the opposition delegation told the Agence France-Presse news agency on condition of anonymity. A decision was expected later on Sunday, the committee member added. The Syrian Observatory said that several other towns were considering a similar evacuation deal with the regime on Sunday. "A decision could be taken any moment for Hammuriyeh, Jisreen, and Saqba," Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. However, Failaq al-Rahman, the rebel faction that controls Hammuriyeh, denied it was engaged in evacuation talks.

"No one has been authorized to negotiate on behalf of Ghouta's revolutionaries, institutions, or the Free Syrian Army." On Friday, 13 fighters from the Nusra Front, al-Qaida's former Syrian arm, were allowed to leave eastern Ghouta with their families after striking a deal with the Assad regime.
