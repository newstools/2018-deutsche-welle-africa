Toys ‘R' Us on Thursday announced it would close all its US stores after being unable find a buyer or reach a deal to restructure billions of dollars in debt. "This is a profoundly sad day for us as well as the millions of kids and families who we have served for the past 70 years," CEO Dave Brandon said in a statement. "I am very disappointed with the result, but we no longer have the financial support to continue the company's US operations," he added.

The company had huge debt as the result of a $6.6-billion (€5.3 billion) leveraged buyout in 2005 by a consortium that included the KKR Group and Bain Capital. Toys 'R' Us was taken private, with a view to take it back to the stock market after a restructuring period. The closure of the 70-year-old retailer in the US will affect some 30,000 employees.

Similar to other stores, Toys 'R' Us has suffered due to competition from online retailers such as Amazon. In a last-ditch attempt to save the company, Toys ‘R' Us is "in discussions with certain interested parties" regarding a transaction that could see 200 of the top performing US stores combined with its Canadian operations, Brandon said. But while discussions take place, the company has sought court approval for the liquidation of its US stores with the right to recall any stores included in the proposed Canadian transaction.
