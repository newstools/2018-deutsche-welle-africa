Cities are responsible for 70 percent of manmade CO2 emissions, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Cars, heating, cooling and lighting systems work round the clock, consuming energy and pumping out emissions. But more and more cities are aiming to source a growing share of that energy from renewables, to become more sustainable and, ultimately, combat climate change. Around the world, 570 cities have reported their achievements to non-profit group CDP. CDP says over 100 of them get least 70 percent of their electricity from renewable sources, and more than 40 already have a 100-percent renewable power supply. That might sound impressive. But, electricity isn't everything — cities also consume huge amounts of energy from heating and transport, for example. Moreover, "renewable" doesn't always mean environmentally sound. Most of the 40 high achievers get their electricity from hydropower plants, which are controversial due to the environmental impacts of dams, and fears that hydropower generation is being hit by climate change. Renewable cities, key for climate Half the world's human population lives in cities, and at least 90 percent of people in urban areas live with air quality that falls short of World Health Organization standards. There's clearly much to be done to reduce urban toll on human and planetary health. But CDP says the data cities have submitted show they're making a start. "Cities have high ambitions and are taking big steps," Kyra Appleby, director of cities at CDP, told DW. More than 80 cities and towns in the United Kingdom have pledged to go 100-percent renewable by 2050 as part of UK100, a local government leaders' network.

Many other European cities are moving towards renewables, not only for electricity but also for heating and transport, Eric Woods, research director with Navigant Research, a green energy tech consultancy, told DW. Falling green power prices are helping drive this transition. In 2017, unsubsidized renewables were the cheapest source of electricity in 30 countries, and renewable energy is predicted to become far cheaper than energy from fossil fuels by 2020. A US awakening Despite US President Donald Trump's resistance to the energy transition  — or perhaps, in part, because of it — US cities are redoubling their efforts, too. Across the country, 58 cities have committed to going 100-percent renewable. Of these, 46, including big cities like Atlanta and San Diego, only pledged after Trump's election. The Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy has also been a major push for local urban energy transitions, seeing more than 7,000 cities and local governments around the world agree to act on climate change.

Burlington, Vermont, gets all its electricity from a mix of biomass, hydro, solar and wind power, CDP data shows andaccording to the Sierra Club, it's not alone. Aspen (Colorado), Greensburg (Kansas), Rock Port (Missouri) and Kodiak Island (Alaska) may be small, but they too have completely given up fossil-fueled electricity. Lessons to learn The road to renewables needs adequate governance. Some cities — for example those that own their own municipal utilities, like Basel and Copenhagen — have more power over where they get their energy from. "Cities need more control over their energy production and stronger support for local generation," Woods said. Local authorities are often more active than national ones, but they are also limited by national energy policy. Different cities have different resources available to them. In Geneva, the city's lake is used to cool and heat around 400 buildings, including the United Nations' headquarters, Alix Bolle, EU affairs manager with Energy Cities told DW. But while not every 100-percent renewable city will look the same, their localized transitions are a chance to try out different solutions, and learn from each other's experience. Initiatives like the UK100 andRenewables Networking Platform , promoted by the European Forum for Renewable Energy Sources, encourage such exchange. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

It's also important that the energy transition is an inclusive process, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently stressed, bringing the public and local industry into decision-making to ensure everyone does their bit. Carina Borgström-Hansson, responsible for WWF's One Planet City Challenge, told DW that involving the local private sector means the energy transition can stimulate entrepreneurship and job creation. She points to Vancouver, Canada, which she says included local businesses in a strategy that has seen the city achieve a 98-percent renewable electricity supply. Reshaping the energy system obviously involves serious investment in infrastructure. But there are also simple things we can all do to decarbonize our cities. Electrification of the transport system is very important, Borgström-Hansson said, but we can all make an effort to take more journeys by bike or foot. Copenhagen wants to become the world's first carbon-neutral capital by 2025. Since 1995, it has reduced its carbon emissions by half. It stands out for its efforts on sustainable mobility, with large car-free zones, high quality public transport and impressive cycling facilities. District heating and cooling systems – some of which use cold seawater – do their bit to reduce emissions, too. The Icelandic capital already has a renewable supply of heat and electricity – mainly from hydropower and geothermal. An impressive 95 percent of homes are connected to the district heating network. The city is also aiming to make all public transport fossil-free by 2040 and strongly encourages residents to do without their cars. In Brazil's eighth biggest city, around 60 percent of the population relies on the urban bus network. They also have 250 kilometers of bike lines at their disposal, as well as the country's first major pedestrianized street, Rua das Flores. Curitiba's green belt provides natural protection against flooding. But its rapid population growth is putting its green ambitions under pressure. In 2016, San Francisco passed a law that all new buildings must set aside space for rooftop photovoltaic systems – the first major US city to do so. Plastic bags have been banned since 2007, and it introduced an urban food waste program in 2009. Now, it plans to go waste-free by 2020. Plus, the majority of its buses and light rails are zero-emission. Germany's financial center was one of the first cities to adopt a roadmap towards a 100 percent renewable energy supply by 2050. New buildings must follow strict guidelines on energy efficiency. Controversial materials like PVC are forbidden, and it has drastically reduced its waste, thanks to a modern waste management system. Frankfurt also has ambitious plans for e-mobility. Vancouver is trying to become the world's greenest city by 2020. By then, it seeks to reduce carbon emissions by 33 percent compared to 2007. The city's electricity comes almost entirely from hydroelectric dams, but it still needs to move away from natural gas and oil for heating and transportation. The goal is to reduce per-capita ecological footprint by 33 percent. Kigali has been described as Africa's cleanest city. It's planning to develop pedestrian and cycling corridors. Plastic bags are banned and citizens spend a day each month cleaning up the city, where it's rare to find litter. However, human rights groups have denounced the high price of this "cleanliness," which they say is as an excuse to impose a discriminatory control over the population. The European Green Capital 2016 gets all its electricity from hydropower. It has a strong focus on public transport, pedestrian and cycling networks, and has banned cars from its city center. It was the first European city to aim for zero waste, and already recycles over 60 percent – one of the highest rates in Europe. Author: Irene Banos Ruiz
