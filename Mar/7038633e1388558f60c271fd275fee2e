In the first two months of this year, 10,243 migrants entered Europe via the Mediterranean Sea, compared with 17,438 during the same time in 2017, according to the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM). This year, roughly half of migrants attempting to reach Europe by seaarrived in Italy, with the remainder reaching the shores of Greece andSpain.
