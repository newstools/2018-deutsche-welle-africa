German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has visited India several times as foreign minister and vice chancellor. His upcoming five-day visit, starting from Thursday, March 22, will focus on boosting economic and strategic ties between the two countries. Germany is India's largest trade partner in the European Union bloc. Indian foreign ministry officials told DW the German president was expected to further enhance bilateral economic cooperation during his visit. "New Delhi and Berlin realize they can achieve a lot more. That is why Steinmeier's trip is important, as Germany is not only an economic powerhouse but has an influence on the European Union's policies," a foreign ministry official told DW. During his trip, Steinmeier will meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other high-level government officials, including Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj. The German president will also visit the southern Indian city of Chennai, one of India's economic hubs with many German businesses.

Parthasarathy, a former diplomat, said Germany and France are expected to play a bigger economic role within the EU after the Brexit process is completed. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron visited India and signed several trade and security deals with New Delhi. "The reality is that India has to rely more on Germany if it wants to continue with its economic progress. The smaller European countries do not matter much," Parthasarathy told DW. Rajendra Jain, a professor at the Centre for European Studies in New Delhi, said Germany is pivotal to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's foreign policy because of its economic and political clout in the world. "India needs Germany to invest in its infrastructure, renewable energy projects, skills development and water management," Jain told DW.
