Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party took its first step on Tuesday toward taking control of the country's top judicial body. The PiS-controlled lower house of parliament approved the party's list of 15 candidates to sit on the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), the body intended to oversee judicial impartiality. In protest against the new measures, the entire centrist opposition boycotted the vote and refused to present its own candidates. Read more: Poland and the EU...

He added that the KRS "had done nothing to purge its ranks of judges who were real murderers in robes who had sentenced Polish patriots to death" during Stalinist trials of the 1950s. Judges and opposition decry vote Despite the PiS' insistence that the judicial oversight body remained haunted by its communist past, outgoing KRS judge Waldemar Zurek described the new reforms as "frightening" Read more: What are Poland's judicial reforms proposed by Jaroslaw Kaczynski? Zurek told the AFP news agency that he also believed plans to establish a KRS disciplinary arm "will have the goal of carrying out the dirty work of getting rid of insubordinate judges." Borys Budka, a former justice minister and member of the opposition Civic Platform, said the vote marked the end of the separation of powers between politics and the rule of law.
