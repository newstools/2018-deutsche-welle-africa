Over a year after the terror attack on a Berlin Christmas market that claimed 12 lives, Germany's Bundestag has opened a parliamentary inquiry into the case.

Unlike congressional probes in the United States, which are formed within pre-established committees, lawmakers in the Bundestag are able to form entirely separate investigative panels to probe a diverse range of issues, including scandals, terror attacks and international affairs. Why are they there? Investigative committees are used as a monitoring tool by parliament to investigate possible abuses, mismanagement, inaction or incorrect actions by the federal government and federal agencies. The inquiries also examine possible misconduct by politicians and civil servants. Only 25 percent support among parliamentarians is required to establish an investigative committee, making them a powerful tool for opposition parties. The committees have the power to call witnesses and experts to testify in front of the panel. Unlike state parliamentary inquiries, committees on the federal level also have access to files and records from federal agencies, making their inquiries more comprehensive. They also publish the results of their findings in a report that is presented to the rest of parliament and made available to the public.

All parties in the Bundestag must be represented in every investigative committee, and the total nuber of participants depends on the makeup of parliament and is not set. For this current session of the Bundestag, 18 lawmakers — nine regular and nine deputy members — will likely take part in the committees. The parties must be represented proportionally to reflect their seats in parliament. Each group of regular and deputy members will be comprised of three members from the conservative Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) bloc, two from the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and one member each from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP), the socialist Left party and the Greens. This is the first legislative session the AfD will be able to take part in the committees. However, the party doesn't have a strong enough presence in the Bundestag to trigger the creation of any of the committees by itself. After their four-year absence from the national stage, the FDP will once again be part of the committees, as well. Each party decides which of their MPs will sit on a given committee.

The head of the AfD in Leipzig was the center of controversy in 2016 when newspapers reported that a car in his motor pool had the license plate: "AH 1818." "AH" are the initials of Adolf Hitler. 1 and 8, the first and eighth letters of the alphabet, are considered a code for Adolf Hitler among neo-Nazi groups. As the AfD's lead candidate in Rhineland-Palatinate, the 28-year-old Münzenmaier cruised to a seat in the Bundestag. Münzenmaier made headlines in October when he was convicted of being an accessory to assault in a case of football hooliganism. But because that's considered a minor offense, he is able to exercise his mandate. The 75-year-old former CDU man is the AfD's choice for Bundestag vice-president, but members of the other parties say they won't approve his candidacy. Glaser once opined that Muslims shouldn't enjoy freedom of religion because Islam is a political ideology. Critics reject that view as unconstitutional. Frohnmaier is the chair of the party's youth organization, Junge Alternative. The 28-year-old wrote in August 2016 on Facebook that "our generation will suffer the most" from Merkel's decision to "flood this country with the shoddy proletariat from Africa and the Orient." The former soldier from Lower Saxony once told a journalist that he had no problem with "Germany for the Germans," a phrase that is often used by neo-Nazi groups. He has also collectively described the Green Party and The Left party as "constitutional enemy No. 1." The 77-year-old from Brandenburg was vice president of the Federation of Expellees (BdV) until 2012. He wrote in the newspaper "Ostpreussenblatt" in 2001 that he agreed with the statement that the Holocaust was a "myth" and an "effective instrument to criminalize the Germans and their history." In January, the Dresden judge railed against the "creation of mixed nationalities" that are "destroying national identity." He has also called for an end to Germany's "culture of guilt" surrounding the country's actions in the Second World War. The AfD's vice-chair is an MP in the European parliament and is known for her hardline conservative views. In 2016, she replied affirmatively to a Facebook user who had asked her whether armed force should be used to stop women with children from illegally entering Germany. She later apologized for the comment. One of the AfD's top candidates, Gauland was widely criticized after suggesting that the German government's commissioner for integration, Aydan Özoguz, should be "disposed of" in Turkey because she had said that there was no specifically German culture beyond the German language. The 38-year-old economist was the AfD's other top candidate. Despite living in Switzerland, Weidel ran for the Baden-Württemberg constituency of Bodensee. She drew criticism for describing Germany's integration commissioner Aydan Özoguz, who has Turkish roots, as a "stain" and a "disgrace." In a contested email attributed to Weidel, she called Angela Merkel's government "pigs" and "puppets." For a long time Frauke Petry was the face of the AfD, and she's one of the more recognizable figures in the Bundestag. But she's no longer a member of the right-wing populist party. Petry quit shortly after the election after falling out with other leaders. Because she won her voting district outright, she still gets a Bundestag mandate, where she sits as an independent. Author: Alex Pearson Do they have time limits? All investigative committees must wrap up their work by the end of a parliamentary term. Depending on when the inquiry is formed, they have up to four years to present a final report. Sometimes they can be called upon to present an interim report or a preliminary report if the committee runs out of time. In certain instances, however, cases can continue to be investigated if the next parliament agrees to form another committee on it. For example, there have been two consecutive Bundestag investigations into the National Socialist Underground (NSU) terror group, running from 2012-2013 and again from 2015-2017.

The parliamentary inquiries have the power to make recommendations in their reports, such as changes to the law as well as having courts and administrative agencies carry out investigations. Their ability to enact change, however, is less straight-forward. Often, investigative committees are formed months or years after an event or scandal takes place. This means it can be hard to determine whether the consequences for those involved resulted from the inquiry or from other factors. A parliamentary inquiry from 2014 to 2017 into the US National Security Agency (NSA) espionage activities in Germany led to consequences for the German foreign intelligence agency (BND), including the dismissal of BND leadership. The affair didn't have consequences for government officials in the Chancellery, however, who were supposed to oversee BND activities. The true power of parliamentary inquiries, perhaps, lies in their final reports — many of which are hundreds of pages long — and the transparency they provide to the public.
