All of Hollywood was waiting to see how Jimmy Kimmel would open the 90th annual Academy Awards. Would he deal with the sexual harassment scandals? Yes, he did. The late-night host mentioned disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein by name and said he deserved to be expelled from the Academy most of all. He joked that the Oscar statuette is the ideal embodiment of the moment — "as he always keeps his hands where we can see them." Kimmel also acknowledged the #MeToo and Time's Up movements against sexual misconduct and gender inequality, saying the audience could expect to hear more about them later in the show. The reform movements have dominated the awards circuit this year, and the ceremonies have been an opportunity for Hollywood to support women in filmmaking.

"It's really important that you know that Time's Up is not about the red carpet," said powerhouse Hollywood producer Shonda Rhimes ("Grey's Anatomy," "Scandal") ahead of the ceremony. "And those women you saw on the red carpet representing Time's Up are now off the red carpet working their butts off being activists."

Indeed, one study claimed that Weinstein was thanked more often than God in acceptance speeches. Tradition was also broken in another manner. Typically the previous year's best actor winner would present that statuette, but Casey Affleck, who won the award in 2017 for "Manchester by the Sea," withdrew under amid a pair of sexual harassment accusations. He has denied the allegations.

Starring Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh and directed by Victor Fleming, it received 10 Academy Awards in 1940 (eight competitive, two honorary). Supporting actress Hattie McDaniel became the first Black American to win an Oscar. The monumental epic directed by William Wyler already started breaking records before it was even produced, going through 40 script versions. Its budget of over $15 million was larger than that of any film produced at the time. Its cast included 10,000 extras; some 2,500 horses were used to shoot the movie. It went on to win 11 Academy Awards — another record, tied by only two other films since. Francis Ford Coppola's gangster classic won the Oscar for best picture in 1973; Marlon Brando was also recognized for his unforgettable performance as mafia don Vito Corleone. However, the actor stirred controversy by refusing to accept his Academy Award, in protest against the treatment of Native Americans in the US. The ambitious historical film directed by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci is about the life of the last Emperor of China, Puyi, who ascended to the throne at the age of two and had to live detained in the Forbidden City. The biographical work won nine Oscars. The legendary thriller nabbed five Oscars in 1992. Adapted from a Thomas Harris novel, it centers on a psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer called Hannibal Lecter — terrifically portrayed by Anthony Hopkins, earning him an Academy Award. His co-star, Jodie Foster (as FBI trainee Clarice Starling, pictured), and the movie's director, Jonathan Demme, both picked up a statue as well. Steven Spielberg's epic historical drama portrays the horrors of the Holocaust through the story of German businessman Oskar Schindler, who saved the lives of over a thousand Jews by making them work in his factories during World War II. Earning eight Oscars, the work starring Liam Neeson (picture), Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley is often listed as one of the best films ever made. The characters depicted by Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet memorably fell in love in this fictionalized account of the sinking of the Titanic. With a production budget of $200 million, the masterpiece directed by James Cameron was the most expensive film ever made at the time. It picked up 11 gold statues in 1998, tying the record set by "Ben-Hur." Nominated in 11 categories, Peter Jackson's third installment in the fantasy trilogy also won 11 Academy Awards — making it the record-holder for the highest Oscar sweep. Altogether, the three films based on J. R. R. Tolkien's "The Lords of the Rings" novels collected 17 Oscars. Starring Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, this black-and-white homage to the silent film era from the 1920s barely contains any dialogue. The comedy-drama directed by Michel Hazanavicius won many accolades around the world, including five Oscars. It was the first French production to win best picture; Jean Dujardin also became the first Frenchman to win Best Actor. The coming-of-age drama directed by Barry Jenkins (pictured here on set with actor Alex Hibbert in the role of Chiron as a child) memorably won best picture after "La La Land" was initially announced as the winner by mistake. "Moonlight" became the first film with an all-black cast and centering on a LGBT story to win the prestigious accolade.
