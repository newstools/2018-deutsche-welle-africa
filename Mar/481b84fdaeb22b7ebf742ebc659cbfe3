The pro-Catalan independence group Committee for the Defense of the Republic (CDR) urged citizens on Tuesday to block several roads and paralyze traffic to protest the detention of Carles Puigdemont in Germany. The CDR has also called for a "general strike" in Barcelona, to begin at 16:00 UTC and to close the city's Sants rail station. Tuesday's demonstrations were the latest in a string of protests that have taken place in Catalonia since tensions were reignited between pro-independence supporters and the Spanish state.

The AP-7 motorway that links the region with France was one of the highways affected. Catalonian police forces intervened to remove protesters who were sitting on the Ap-7 in order to stop traffic.

The motorway, which runs between the cities of Tarragona and Valencia, was eventually cleared of protesters by the regional police. In Barcelona, demonstrators attempted to close the Diagonal Avenue, one of the main city routes, with banners reading "freedom for political prisoners" and "general strike." Empresaris de Catalunya, an organization that represents Catalonia's business community, rejected Tuesday's "general strike" and warned about the damage that the recent day of protests would cause. "We cannot allow chaos and instability to be established again in our society," the business association's statement read. The group stressed that the social tension produced by the efforts from pro-independence forces represented "a risk to the economy and employment in Catalonia."

The CDR called for the beginning of "the Catalan spring", in reference to the pro-democracy protest movement that swept Middle Eastern and North African countries in 2011. The statement called for protests across the region to reject "Spanish occupation" and for "the effective building of the republic." Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

The group is also encouraging its supporters to surround the main Sants train station in Barcelona. Read more:German court extends Carles Puigdemont detention Tensions between Catalonia and Spain boiled over again when a Spanish judge issued a string of arrest warrants last Friday that included 13 Catalan politicians. Among those detained was the newest candidate for the Catalan presidency, Jordi Turull, who was supposed to be elected to the post on Saturday. Read more: Spain charges 13 Catalan politicians with rebellion Over the weekend, Spain also reactivated the European arrest warrant on Carles Puigdemont, who was in Finland meeting with lawmakers. The ex-Catalan premier was arrested by German police on Sunday as he was on his way to Brussels. He will remain in custody until German courts decide on the extradition. A decision is not expected before Easter. Puigdemont wovs to "never surrender" Carles Puigdemont expressed "his full trust in the German legal system," his attorney Gonzalo Boya said on Tuesday, and vowed to keep fighting on behalf of the cause of Catalan independence. "He has said we will never surrender and that is his message to the Catalan people and also that they have the right to express their willingness for independence and a republic in Catalonia," attorney Boye said. As the world watched, Catalonia's parliament voted 70 to 10 for the region to declare its independence from Spain. "Our legitimate parliament has taken a very important step. This is the people's mandate," Puigdemont said after the decision. Dozens of opposition lawmakers from the Socialist Party, Citizens Party and Popular Party had walked out of the parliament chamber to boycott the vote. Within an hour of the Catalan vote, the Spanish Senate in Madrid passed a bill to trigger Article 155 of the Spanish constitution. The measure will allow the central government to suspend Catalonia's autonomy. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would sack Catalonia’s government and set new regional elections for December 21. European leaders were quick to condemn the independence declaration. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the Union "doesn't need any more cracks," while EU Council President Donald Tusk said Madrid "remains our only interlocutor." Leaders in Germany, France, Italy and the UK voiced their support for Madrid. The US also chimed in, saying "Catalonia is an integral part of Spain." Barcelona and Madrid had been in a standoff since 93 percent of voters opted for Catalan independence in an October 1 referendum marred by police violence. Spain said the poll was illegal and stressed the low voter turnout of 43 percent. It subsequently threatened to suspend the region's autonomy if Catalan leaders did not stop their drive for independence. Many had expected tensions to ease on October 26 when Catalan President Carles Puigdemont was expected to call snap elections to bow to a key Spanish government demand. But Puigdemont refused, saying that he did not have enough "guarantees" from Madrid. Instead, he called on the Catalan parliament to decide on how to respond to Spain's threat to suspend the region's autonomy. Tens of thousands of pro-independence protesters had taken to the streets of Barcelona ahead of the independence declaration to demand the region's secession and the release of two leaders of pro-independence organizations, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez. Independence has divided Catalonia. Many who supported continued unity with Spain refused to vote in the October 1 referendum. The pro-independence crowds outside the Catalan parliament immediately rejoiced after hearing the independence declaration. Many people were draped in the "Estelada" flag associated with Catalan independence. Some reportedly called for the Spanish flag to be removed from the Catalan government palace as regional lawmakers arrived from the parliament.
