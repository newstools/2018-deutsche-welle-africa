They've called each other "Little Rocket Man" and a "mentally deranged dotard." After trading public insults and military threats, could an antagonistic duo strike a denuclearization agreement that decades of diplomatic efforts failed to produce? US President Donald Trump believes he has the reputation for deal-making and the instincts needed to bring North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his nuclear arsenal into line. "It's certainly possible that the two men will understand each other on a deeper level because of their own sense of self-importance," said Isaac Stone Fish, a senior fellow at the Asia Society in Washington, DC. "The two men might end up really respecting each other. We've seen glimmers of that from Trump when he made comments about Kim Jong Un taking over family business at age of 27, which is same age Trump took over his [family's business]." Foolhardy gamble? Yet many stunned foreign policy observers see Thursday's extraordinary announcement as a foolhardy gamble that will grant a dangerous regime the international legitimacy it craves. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in his New Year’s address that his country was in the "final stages" of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). US President-elect Donald Trump, whose inauguration was set for January 20, said on Twitter: "North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the US. It won't happen!" North Korea tested its first ICBM — the Hwasong-14 — on US Independence Day. Kim reportedly told his scientists that "the US would be displeased" by the launch. This, he said, was because "it was given a 'package of gifts' ... on its 'Independence Day.'" Trump wrote on Twitter in response: "North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?" Pyongyang tested its second Hwasong-14 weeks later. Experts estimated the new rocket could reach the US mainland. Trump lashed out at North Korean ally China, writing in a Tweet: "I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk." Trump appeared to threaten swift military action against Pyongyang when he told reporters: "North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen." North Korea responded by threatening to fire a medium-range ballistic missile into the waters around Guam, a US territory in the Pacific Ocean. It did not follow through. Pyongyang sparked international outcry when it test-launched a mid-range ballistic missile — the Hwasong-12 — over Japan. The UN Security Council unanimously condemned the test. Trump said in a White House statement: "Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime’s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table." North Korea announced it had successfully tested its sixth nuclear weapon. Pyongyang said it was a powerful type of nuclear weapon called a hydrogen bomb and that it could be placed on top of a ballistic missile. Trump wrote on Twitter: "The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea." In his first speech at the United Nations, Trump called North Korea a "rogue state" and said Washington "will have no choice than to totally destroy North Korea" if Pyongyang failed to stop its nuclear weapons program. Referring to Kim, he added: "Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime." Kim called Trump a "mentally-deranged US dotard" two days later. North Korea test-fired its third ICBM of 2017. Pyongyang claimed it was a new missile, the Hwasong-15, which was superior to the Hwasong-14 and could hit any target on the US mainland. The US urged allies, including Germany, to break diplomatic ties with North Korea. Berlin ignored the call. Trump also called Kim a "sick puppy." Kim said in his 2018 New Year's address that the North had completed its nuclear weapons program and that a "nuclear button" was on his desk at all times. Trump wrote two days later on Twitter: "Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!" South Korean President Moon Jae-in welcomed Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, at the presidential house in the South Korean capital. She handed a letter to Moon inviting him to meet the North Korean leader in Pyongyang. Tensions appeared to be thawing. Seoul and Pyongyang had already agreed to send a unified hockey team to compete at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong led a delegation on March 5 to Pyongyang to discuss the potential for peace talks. The next day, Chung said both sides had agreed to hold a joint summit in April and set up a telephone hotline between the two capitals. He also said Pyongyang would agree to stop its nuclear weapons and missile tests if the US agreed to hold talks with the North. Chung flew on to Washington, D.C. to speak with Trump. After the meeting, Chung told reporters the US president had agreed to meet Kim by May. Trump later wrote on Twitter: "no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!" Foreign leaders welcomed the historic breakthrough. Author: Alexander Pearson South Korea's national security adviser Chung Eui-yong told White House press that North Korea's Kim would like to sit down with Trump, and that the country would be willing to temporarily suspend its nuclear and missile testing while the meeting took place. Even more shockingly, the US president immediately accepted the invitation without preconditions. A day later, the White House tried to suggest the meeting was not in fact a done deal. If the encounter does take place it would be the first time an American president meets with a North Korean leader while in office. It's not a coincidence that this arrangement is unprecedented; North Korea has been trying to arrange a meeting with a sitting US president for decades, and there are many reasons why they've been rebuffed. The meeting that US and South Korean officials said would take place before the end of May carries sizable risk. North Korea wants to be taken seriously on the world stage, and its nuclear weapons afford it plenty of attention. By meeting face-to-face with Kim Jong Un, Trump would be extending international legitimacy to a country that's carried out sweeping human rights abuses. A meeting could also be a ploy to give Kim time to further develop his nuclear weapons program.

The State Department's top diplomat for North Korea, Joseph Yun, announced his surprise retirement in February, sparking concerns over Trump's policies. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who met with the South Korean envoys to discuss Trump's possible meeting with Kim, is widely rumored to be on his way out. Trump's administration still hasn't even filled the role of ambassador to South Korea. Victor Cha, a one-time candidate for that post and former National Security Council Director for Asian Affairs, questioned what, exactly, could go up for negotiation, tweeting, "The question becomes what (are) we putting on table: sanctions? Normalization? Peace treaty?" This time North Korea would come to the table with much greater nuclear and missile capabilities — and therefore more bargaining power. If talks fall apart, it could further escalate tensions. North Korea could also test another missile ahead of a potential meeting. "We don't actually know how much control Kim Jong Un has over top generals in his administration,” says Fish. "It's possible one of them wants to torpedo the summit." He thinks a Trump-Kim meeting is the least bad option available because it could prevent war and buy time in which North Korea could collapse or evolve. In August 2017, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution banning all coal, iron, iron ore and lead imports from North Korea. Pictured here is China's Liaoning Greenland Energy Coal Co. in Dandong, on the border with North Korea. North Korea is prohibited from opening banks abroad, and UN member states are prohibited from operating financial institutions on Pyongyang's behalf. Any dealings that might help North Korea skirt the sanctions are banned, and UN member states must expel and repatriate anyone working on the regime's financial behalf. This North Korean cargo ship found itself boarded for inspection in the Philippines in March 2016 after the United Nations ordered member nations to de-register any vessel owned, operated or crewed on orders from Pyongyang. North Korean ships also cannot fly the flags of other nations to evade sanctions. Air Koryo, North Korea's national carrier, remains exempt from aviation sanctions and still has scheduled flights to China and Russia, as well as several domestic routes. However, the airline cannot fly to the European Union, which has banned it on safety grounds, and the United States prevents citizens from legally conducting business with the carrier. In December 2017, a new raft of UN sanctions targeted fuel imports in North Korea, meaning its residents could have difficulties driving the country in Pyeonghwa sedans (pictured above). The sale and transfer of diesel and kerosene are limited while the import of crude oil is capped at 4 million barrels a year. UN sanctions limit North Korea's diplomats abroad — at the country's Berlin embassy, for example — to only one bank account each. North Korea is also not permitted to own real estate abroad for any purposes other than consular. It's a safe bet that North Korea's marching military did not learn its moves abroad: UN sanctions ban foreign security forces from training the country's army, police or paramilitary units. The United Nations does permit medical exchanges, but otherwise allow very little assistance of scientific or technical value. Anyone wanting to own a larger-than-life Kim will have to await the end of North Korea's nuclear program. The UN sanctions currently ban the sale of statues by the nation. Breaking precedent North Korea's nuclear program has long been one of the stickiest foreign policy challenges for the US. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was the highest-level American official to visit North Korea while in office. She traveled to Pyongyang in 2000 to set up a trip for Bill Clinton after he was invited by Kim Jong Il, but the president never made the journey. After Clinton left office he did, however, meet with Kim Jong Il to help negotiate the release of two American journalists from North Korea. George W. Bush included North Korea in his "axis of evil" and the Obama administration ramped up sanctions. Tensions flared over the past year thanks to Pyongyang's firing of intercontinental ballistic missiles and testing what is thought to be a hydrogen bomb, but relations between the two Koreas appeared to thaw somewhat after North Korea's participation in the Winter Olympics hosted in PyeongChang in February. Could casting aside the unsuccessful orthodoxy of US foreign policy and giving North Korea a taste of its own medicine with an unpredictable and volatile leader help the US break what has become a dangerous impasse? "Although Trump has many weaknesses, [the meeting] does play to some of his strengths," Fish says. The stakes might be high, but expectations for a Trump-Kim meeting are relatively muted. Following a year of escalating tensions over the threat of a catastrophic nuclear war, even a lousy deal with North Korea could be hailed as a success.
