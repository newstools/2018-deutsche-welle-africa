The European Parliament has backed a resolution supporting a recommendation from the European Commission to invoke Article 7 against Poland. The lawmakers voted in favor of taking action against Poland for undermining the EU rule of law with reforms to the Polish judiciary. Following two years of talks with Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) that have achieved no results, the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, last December recommended Article 7 be triggered against the Polish government, a move that could result in the suspension of its voting rights in the EU, unless it concedes ground by March 20. The European Parliament on Thursday voted 422 in favor to 147 against, with 48 abstentions, on a nonbinding resolution to support the Commission's action against the EU's largest former communist state.

It's complicated The Commission said one of the most controversial reforms was the Polish government's decision to grant the president greater powers to appoint judges to the Supreme Court, whose duties include confirming election results. "Despite efforts for a constructive dialogue for 2 years, we have concluded that there is a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law in Poland," the Commission said in a statement posted on Twitter in December. "Judicial reforms in Poland mean that the country's judiciary is now under the political control of the ruling majority. In the absence of judicial independence, serious questions are raised about the effective application of EU law," it added. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
