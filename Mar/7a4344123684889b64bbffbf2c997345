US allies including Australia, Japan, and the 28-member European Union asked Washington to grant them waivers from the new US tariffs on imported steel and aluminum on Friday. Previously, US President Donald Trump said "real friends" might be exempt from the controversial measures. When signing the document on Thursday, Trump also said Canada and Mexico would be granted exemptions pending a new deal on the NAFTA trade agreement. Canada is the biggest supplier of steel imported by the United States. The tariffs are set to go into effect in two weeks. After meeting with industry representatives, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the new tariffs are "not good." "Talks must be the preference right now," Merkel said. "The best would be if we are exempt." German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said, "This protectionism is an affront to close partners like the European Union and Germany and limits free trade." The EU has repeatedly warned it would retaliate if its steel exports were to be targeted by the measure. Following Trump's proclamation, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said Trump's decision was not yet "crystal clear." "We are counting on being excluded," the commissioner said.

The European Steel Association EUROFER backed the call for countermeasures. Malmstrom is expected to seek clarification while meeting the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japanese Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko in Brussels on Saturday. 'We are an ally, not a threat' By putting the tariffs in place, Trump invoked a rarely used law that allows the president to move against imports that undermine national security. "A skilled, trained workforce in steel is a crucial element of America's national security and must be protected," Trump said. EU officials, however, rejected this justification. "We are an ally, not a threat," said European Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen, adding that Trump's statements sounded "very protectionist — economy without competition."
