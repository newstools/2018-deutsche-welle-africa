President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has won the presidential elections in Egypt, according to state media. Official results will not be published until Monday, but reports suggest he garnered more than 90 percent of the vote. Turnout, however, was low, hovering around 40 percent, according to state media. After warning people who do not vote they would be fined 500 Egyptian pounds ($30), the election commission extended voting by an hour. Voters had trickled into polling stations as authorities encouraged them to show up in high numbers.

"The voice of the Egyptian masses will undoubtedly bear witness to the fact that our nation's will imposes itself with a force that knows no weakness," he posted on Twitter. "The scenes of Egyptians at polling stations will remain a point of pride and honor for me and undoubted proof of the greatness of our nation that has offered the blood of its greatest sons so that we can together cross into the future." Running against a supporter El-Sissi won his first term in 2014, a year after ousting his Islamist predecessor Mohammed Morsi. He won that election with almost 97 percent of the vote, against a left-wing candidate. His sole rival is the little-known Moussa Mostafa Moussa, who is himself an el-Sissi supporter. Some of his serious rivals withdrew, citing restrictions, some were sidelined, others arrested. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

Millions registered, few turn out There were some 60 million people in Egypt who were registered to vote on March 26, 27, and 28. In the last election in 2014, about 37 percent of voters participated in the two-day election. The low turnout prompted authorities to add a third day to obtain a final participation rate of 47.5 percent. Opposition groups had called for a boycott of this week's election which they called a facade. El-Sissi did not appear at any official campaign events and there were no presidential debates. El-Sissi did, however, speak at a number of ceremonies. In an interview a few days ahead of the vote, el-Sissi had said he wished there were more candidates. He denied having any role in sidelining them. ng,av/kms (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
