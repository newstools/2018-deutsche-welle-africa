Whistleblower Christopher Wylie told UK lawmakers during a committee hearing on Tuesday that a firm linked to Cambridge Analytica had helped the official Brexit Vote Leave campaign avoid campaign financing laws during the referendum. He said that the official campaign's "cheating" may well have swayed the EU referendum result. Facebook shares dropped 4.9 percent on Tuesday and have fallen almost 17 percent since March 16, when Facebook acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Facebook has been slammed for failing to protect the data of more than 50 million users. Their data was used to further conservative political projects, including Brexit and Donald Trump's presidential victory. From a former White House strategist to a Canadian whistle blower, here are the people involved in what some are describing as Facebook's largest data breach. A 28-year-old Canadian data analytics expert first blew the whistle on the scandal to Britain’s Observer newspaper. Christopher Wylie claims he set up the project for Cambridge Analytica and helped forge links with Donald Trump’s campaign team. He revealed that millions of Facebook profiles were hijacked to influence the election. CA says Wylie has been "misrepresenting himself and the company." Cambridge Analytica CEO, Alexander Nix, was one of several senior executives filmed by an undercover reporter from Britain's Channel 4. Nix claimed credit for Donald Trump's 2016 electoral victory. He also said his political consultancy could feed untraceable messages on social media. Executives bragged that the firm could use misinformation, bribery and even prostitutes to help win elections. A Moldovan-born Cambridge University researcher developed a personality app that harvested the personal data of 30 million Facebook users. Aleksandr Kogan said he passed the information to Cambridge Analytica, under assurances that what he was doing was legal. But now he says the research firm and Facebook are scapegoating him over the scandal. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was criticized for waiting for four days to respond to the scandal. His social media network claims to be the victim of the whole saga, insisting it was unaware of the how the data was being used. Still, Zuckerberg has been summoned by the British and European parliaments, while US consumer regulators have launched an investigation into the firm's use of personal data. Trump's former strategist Steve Bannon helped develop the populist, anti-Washington message that helped the billionaire win the White House. A founding member of right-wing outlet Breitbart News, Bannon is a former board member of Cambridge Analytica and brought in wealthy businessman Robert Mercer as a financial backer. He left the White House last August and Trump has since cut him off. Author: Nik Martin London ‘astonished' Facebook said on Tuesday that it would send one of the CEO's deputies to London, suggesting Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, who "had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject" in April. Damian Collins, the chair of a British committee of MPs investigating the effects of fake news on UK democracy, said on Tuesday that Zuckerberg's decision to send other executives to the UK to answer questions on his behalf was "absolutely astonishing" and urged him to think again. Last October, Facebook sent general counsel, Colin Stretch, for two days of congressional hearings. ‘Fixing' Facebook Zuckerberg said earlier this year his personal goal was to "fix" Facebook after a series of PR mishaps for the giant social media company. Zuckerberg and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, have been warning that the company was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended. The company acknowledged last September that it had sold advertisements to Russian agents seeking to influence the US presidential election. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
