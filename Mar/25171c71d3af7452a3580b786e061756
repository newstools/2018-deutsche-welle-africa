Borussia Mönchengladbach 2-2 Werder Bremen (Zakaria 5', Moisander o.g. 33' — Delaney 59', Johannsson 78') It looked like Denis Zakaria had wrapped up three points for Gladbach all by himself on Friday night. The 21-year-old Swiss international opened the scoring with a tidy finish and later delivered a dangerous low cross that Niklas Moisander diverted into his own goal while trying to clear the ball. Youngster Zakaria was sure-footed in the snow in the first period Despite their poor recent form and the difficult snowy conditions, a 2-0 home lead might have seemed unassailable for the hosts. But Werder Bremen continued to press forward, as Gladbach began to lack ideas on the ball. Slapdash marking from a corner allowed Bremen back into contention. Loanee Reece Oxford lost track of Thomas Delaney in the box, allowing the Dane a free header from near the penalty spot. Despite, or perhaps thanks to a deflection off Delaney's own shoulder, the ball looped past Yann Sommer into the top corner. American Aron Johannsson broke a lengthy scoring drought — he hadn't netted since 2016 in the league — to salvage a valuable point for Bremen, who are still in the battle to avoid finishing in the bottom three. But it's Gladbach who are really struggling to find their stride since the winter break. They may still sit in seventh, but the Foals have now taken just 10 points from their last 10 games in the Bundesliga.
