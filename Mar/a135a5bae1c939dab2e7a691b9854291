The Dresden Higher Regional Court on Wednesday found seven men and one woman who formed the "Freital Group" guilty of forming a terror group, attempted murder and aiding and abetting crimes, including attacks on refugees shelters and political opponents. The court handed out prison sentences ranging from four to 10 years. The Freital Group's leaders, identified as Timo S. and Patrick F. in accordance with German press code, received 10 and nine-and-a-half year sentences, respectively. The courtroom in the eastern German state of Saxony was constructed in the high-security state penitentiary in Dresden.

The eight individuals, he claimed, operated in varying capacities with the aim of creating "a climate of fear." Members of the group, however, saw themselves as protecting the German people from refugees, immigrants and those with different political views. The accused are also convinced that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a traitor to the German people. Members discussed and planned who would "get it next" in so-called dark chats online and via telephone. The eight group members targeted hunted refugee aid workers and left-leaning politicians. They acquired explosives — 130 times more powerful than those legally allowed in Germany — in the Czech Republic. They made coded reference to the explosives by calling them "vegetables."

The "Czech firecrackers," he argued, packed a deadly explosive potential, especially in instances in which they were planted on windows — at which point they became fragmentary bombs. The defendants are accused of having done just that in an attack on a refugee center. The federal prosecutors charge that such incidents constitute attempted murder. Police warned Freital-based neo-Nazis Some individual police officers appear to have been more than sympathetic to the Freital Group and its activities. According to media reports, leading members of the Freital Group testified they had received information from one 51-year-old police officer. He is accused of having provided the group with information pertaining to the location and duration of police patrols in the areas where they carried out the attacks. The officer has meanwhile been suspended. In fact, it is only thanks to the German Federal Prosecutor's Office that the Freital Group even became the subject of a trial of this scope. Federal prosecutors took over the case and its investigation from Saxony's state prosecutors in what has become an absolute disgrace for the state's justice department. The strategy of the defense team has been to claim that the Freital Group was neither a criminal nor a terror organization. Andreas Scheider, defense attorney for group member Patrick F., claimed, "what we have here is a series of spontaneous acts." Like his colleague, Michael Sturm, who is defending group member Timo S., he also raised doubts about the lethal potential of the explosives used in the crimes.

He says that paragraph 129a of the StGb requires proof of a minimum level of established organization within the group. Gazeas says the Freital Group's defense team is trying to cast doubt on that point by emphasizing the "spontaneous" nature of the attacks. Read also: Why Germany's far-right flourishes in Dresden Moreover, it must be proven that the group exhibited an overriding will to achieve terrorist aims. Proof of that would be evidenced if the group's members worked in a coordinated fashion, as Gazeas told DW. He, too, is curious to hear the verdict of the Dresden judges. His careful prognosis based on media reports so far: "It is not out of the question that the structure and activities of the Freital Group did cross the legal threshold defining what a terror organization is." Nevertheless, Gazeas, who also teaches law at the University of Cologne, says even if the Dresden court were to come to that conclusion, it will not likely be the last word on the issue: "I am certain that the defense team will appeal, then it will be up to the Federal Court of Justice to decide." Reichsbürger translates to "citizens of the Reich." What unites this loose movement is rejection of the modern Federal Republic of Germany. They believe the 1937 or 1871 borders of the German Empire still exist and today's country is an administrative construct still occupied by the Allied powers. Many subscribe to far-right or anti-Semitic ideologies. Their conspiracy theories have been debunked. The Reichsbürger scene is a disparate, leaderless movement totalling about 15,000 supporters, according to German intelligence officials. Of those, about 900 have been identified as far-right extremists and 1,000 have a license to own firearms. Authorities are concerned about some members' potential to become violent and have conducted several raids on Reichsbürger suspects to sieze weapons. Adrian Ursache, a 42-year-old former winner of the Mister Germany beauty pageant, is also a Reichsbürger member. He is currently facing trial for attempted murder after an August 2016 gun battle with police as they tried to evict him from his home. Typically, Reichsbürger refuse to recognize any state apparatus, printing their own passports and driving licenses. The case of Wolfgang P., who in October 2017 was sentenced to life in prison for murdering a police officer, is seen as a turning point for how German authorities deal with the extremist group. P., an alleged Reichsbürger member, shot at officers who were raiding his home to confiscate weapons. German authorities have been accused of long underestimating the threat posed by the Reichsbürger. Since the murder of the police officer in Bavaria, law enforcement has been cracking down on them more vigorously. In the past year there have been several raids on Reichsbürger targets. Some German police and military forces have also probed whether they may have Reichsbürger among their own ranks. Author: Samantha Early
