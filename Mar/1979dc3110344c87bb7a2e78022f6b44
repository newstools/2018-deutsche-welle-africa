The opera "Artaserse" by Johann Adolph Hasses will be performed for the reopening ceremony on April 12, 2018, following the first opening in 1748. In addition, the Bayreuth Residence Days from April 17 to 29 will take visitors back to the heyday of baroque music theater. You can take a look behind the scenes under the motto "curtain up." The opera house is a wooden log theater with a painted canvas. Because of of its stuccoed, carved and painted decoration it is considered to be unique in the world. At that time, the building was only comparable in size and splendor to houses in Vienna, Dresden, Paris or Venice. Acoustics can also be experienced in the opera house as it was 270 years ago. "With the reopening of the Margravial Opera House, Bayreuth will once again become an attraction for culture and architecture lovers from all over the world," explained Manuel Becher, Managing Director of Bayreuth Marketing & Tourismus GmbH. UNESCO has included the Margravial Opera House Bayreuth (German: Markgr√§fliches Opernhaus Bayreuth) 2012 in the list of World Heritage Sites and honored the opera house as a "unique monument to the European festive and musical culture of the Baroque."
