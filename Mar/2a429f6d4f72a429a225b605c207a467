Jens Spahn, Germany's designated health minister in the incoming government, has defended a food bank's decision to bar foreigners from registering. In an interview on Saturday with Germany's Funke media group, Spahn said that young men queuing up outside the small food bank in the city of Essen looked "so bold and robust that the elderly and single parents no longer had any chance of receiving any food."

Last month, the Tafel food bank in Essen became a flashpoint in Germany for heated debates on xenophobia, migration and poverty, after it decided to stop issuing membership cards to foreigners. Jens Spahn supported the Essen food bank, saying something needed to be done to ensure young people and single parents receive food Jörg Sartor, the chairman of the Essen Tafel food bank, said it had to change the rules because some 75 percent of the 6,000 people who picked up food across the city were foreigners and migrants. Older people and single parents therefore risked being pushed away and deterred, he added. The outcry even saw German Chancellor Angela Merkel weigh into the debate, saying it "wasn't good" that the Tafel was handing out membership cards based on citizenship. However, she also conceded that the situation highlighted "the pressure that [nonprofits] are facing."

While the food banks supported those who were in need, "nobody in Germany would have to starve if the Tafel service didn't exist," he said. While Germany's welfare system, known as Hartz IV, has suffered several cutbacks in recent years, Spahn insisted it would continue to be measured and adjusted under the new government. "Everyone will therefore have what they need to live," the incoming health minister said. Read more: German issues in a nutshell: Hartz IV Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

"I want to convince you of the Union again," Spahn said, referring to the conservative bloc made up of Merkel's CDU and its Bavarian sister-party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). The CDU/CSU lost almost 1 million voters to the AfD in the 2017 federal election. The far-right populist party has become a focal point for anti-migrant sentiment in Germany, while a handful of its lawmakers have been called out for making effectively xenophobic statements. Politicians like the AfD's Björn Höcke "show themselves to be utterly racist, anti-democratic and anti-Semitic," Spahn said.

Nevertheless, Spahn said that AfD voters were not "foregone Nazis," but stressed "that everyone who chooses this party must know who they support." However, the newly appointed health minister also admitted that his CDU and the AfD would "inevitably" vote together on some issues in the Bundestag or state parliaments.
