US President Donald Trump signed an order on Thursday that places new import tariffs on steel and aluminum. Set to come into effect in 15 days, the new policy includes exceptions for imports from Mexico and Canada. Calling steelworkers the "backbone of America," Trump called steel vital to US national security. He added that foreign steel dumping was an "assault" that put US companies and factories out of business. He urged companies to buy American steel and thus avoid import tariffs. Trump said the new policy would get US steel factories reopened and producing at full capacity. "A skilled, trained workforce in steel is a crucial element of America's national security and must be protected," Trump said. Trump said Mexico and Canada would be exempt from the tariffs pending a new NAFTA deal. He said the United States would also be open to negotiations on alternatives to the new tariffs with countries willing to engage in fair trade policies. "Many of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on military are our allies," Trump said. "We want fairness. We want everything to be reciprocal." Global trade war looms The new tariffs raise the prospect of a global trade war and have already hit stock markets hard. Both the European Union and China have said they would retaliate against action by the United States, as have Mexico and Canada. The US neighbors are engaged in so far fruitless talks with Washington to renegotiate NAFTA. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

Countermeasures would include European tariffs on US oranges, tobacco and bourbon, he said. Harley Davidson motorcycles have also been mentioned, targeting House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan's home state of Wisconsin.

Beijing, which until now had kept largely silent on the issue, sharpened its rhetoric significantly. China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, said any action aimed at Beijing would result in "a justified and necessary response." "Especially given today's globalization, choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription. The outcome will only be harmful," Wang said on the sidelines of an annual meeting of China's parliament on Thursday. He also warned that a cascade of trade protectionism risked hurting the global economy, and ultimately the US as well. One lever that China has is US agricultural exports, and it has said in the past that it could target soybeans. Congressional reaction Republicans in Congress have urged the president to take a more surgical approach to tackling the problem of China's flooding of global markets with cheap steel.

Ryan denounced Trump's tariff imposition on Thursday, saying that he feared the "unintended consequences" that the action could bring.

Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Orrin Hatch echoed Ryan's concern and criticized the tariffs but also expressed his willingness to work with the White House to "mitigate the damage." Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who has clashed with the White House before on other issues, strongly condemned Trump's tariff implementation and urged his colleagues to take action. "Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster," he tweeted. Flake announced that he will introduce a bill to the Senate to nullify the tariffs and appealed to his colleagues to pass it before the administration inflicts "more damage on the economy."
