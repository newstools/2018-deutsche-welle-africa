Greek police threw stun grenades and fired tear gas at protesters on Saturday, as they marched in the northern port city of Thessaloniki. Police said tear gas was fired only after demo participants began throwing stones and bottles at the police. Riot police then set in to break up the demonstrators with truncheons and tear gas. The gathering took place in response to recent attacks by nationalists on anarchists, including the burning down of an anarchist collective's premises by far-right protesters during a rally in January. Other attacks on anarchist residences have also been reported in recent weeks. Protesters were reported to have come from across the Balkans, joining like-minded locals for the rally.
