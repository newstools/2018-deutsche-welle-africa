On January 1, Luo Xixi, a computer scientist currently working in Silicon Valley, posted an open letter on the Chinese social media platform Weibo accusing her former technology professor at Beihang University of sexual harassment. In the blog post, she said that in 2004 her PhD advisor Chen Xiaowu had asked her to drive with him to his apartment to help him tend to his houseplants. Luo said Chen complained about his sex life and tried to force her to have sex with him. She remained silent about the incident for 13 years until the #MeToo movement, which emerged in October 2017, inspired her to share her story. She initially posted an anonymous open letter on the Chinese discussion forum Zhihu.com. Soon after, several other former female students who had read her post also accused Chen of sexual harassment.

Luo posted her story with her name on Weibo and ATSH. Within a day, it got over 3 million views. Huang told DW that while the #MeToo campaign encouraged her and other Chinese feminists, China's anti-sexual harassment campaign is not the same. "China's anti-sexual harassment movement actually works differently from the #MeToo movements in Europe and the United States," she said. "It is put under the name of #MeToo because it is easier for the Western media to report about it," she said. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

A few days later, the Chinese Ministry of Education revoked his academic accolade, the "Yangtze River Scholar" award. The publicity of Luo's #MeToo moment also generated a wave of student-led petitions calling for universities to be held accountable for sexual harassment by faculty members. In the weeks after Luo's post, more than 70 petitions were launched. "We brought down Chen Xiaowu and jointly wrote letters to colleges and universities to urge the introduction of anti-harassment mechanisms," said Huang. "In the end, the Ministry of Education promised to establish a mechanism to combat campus sexual assault." "Because college girls are better educated and because society has certain moral expectations of teachers, it is difficult to accept a teacher with such misconduct," Xiao Meili, a Chinese women's rights activist, told DW. "Sexual harassment is very common in China. It is often seen as a problem of bullying, bad behavior or morality. More people should notice that it has more to do with power relations." She added that faculty members who have harassed women don't wield much power over them and students can still graduate after breaking their silence. #MeToo  but by Chinese standards? Although the firing of a prominent university professor and the Ministry of Education's promise to act are steps toward an institutional response to sexual harassment, the filtering and censorship of hashtags and online petitions raise questions about the future of organized feminist campaigns in the country. Xiao was one of many Chinese feminists who posted an open letter, only to see it quickly removed by censors. Her message to her alma mater in Beijing, the Communication University of China, was posted on Weibo and Wechat, and had called for an organized system to prevent sexual harassment at Chinese universities. "Sexual harassment is rampant on Chinese college campuses, and victims who are coerced by their instructors, usually have nowhere to file their allegations," the petition said. "Given the severity of sexual harassment at institutions, we feel obliged to be vocal. It's imperative that Chinese colleges construct a mechanism to prevent sexual harassment on campus." Xiao said her post was deleted because feminist ideas do not meet the mainstream, ideological requirements of the Chinese government. Among the signatories of the open letter was Oscar-nominated French star Catherine Deneuve. Already known for her controversial stance toward harassment, Deneuve has said she finds the #MeToo and #BalanceTonPorc social media actions "excessive." That's after she expressed her support for director Roman Polanski, who is still wanted in the US for the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in 1977. Modern art expert and editor-in-chief of the magazine Art Press, Catherine Millet was also among the signatories who wrote, "Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or cack-handedly, is not — nor is men being gentlemanly a macho attack." Millet is perhaps best known for her book, "The Sexual Life of Catherine M.," a memoir tracing her 30 years in France's swinger scene. German-born Chanson singer, Ingrid Caven, added her name to the open letter, which claims that the protest's legitimacy has turned into a "witch-hunt." "Instead of helping women, this frenzy (...) actually helps the enemies of sexual liberty — religious extremists and the worst sort of reactionaries. As women, we do not recognize ourselves in this feminism." A radio talk show host who got her start in the porn industry in 1976, just a year after it was legalized, Brigitte Lahaie signed the letter, which speaks of a "purifying wave" that knows no limit. "(T)he human being is not monolithic: a woman can in the same day lead a professional team and enjoy being the sexual object of a man without being a 'slut' nor a vile accomplice of the patriarchy." France's version of #MeToo is #BalanceTonPorc, or "call out your pig." Created by NY-based French journalist Sandra Muller, it essentially invites people to name names — and that involves legal risks. Muller herself was asked by lawyers to delete a tweet in which she named a French executive who had said offensive remarks. Prominent feminists quickly responded to the letter signed by Deneuve, saying that it blurred the line between seduction and harassment and in doing so, harmed the "millions of women who suffer from this abuse." Former presidential candidate Ségolène Royal took to Twitter to express her dismay, saying, "It's too bad that our great Catherine Deneuve has signed on to this disconcerting text." Among the women who have accused Harvey Weinstein of inappropriate behavior is French actress Emma De Caunes. De Caunes said she had met Weinstein for lunch at a Paris Hotel in 2010. She was invited to his hotel room to discuss a project but after he walked out of his bathroom naked with an erection, Caunes fled. "It was like a hunter with a wild animal," she said. "The fear turns him on." In October, actress Florence Darel also came out as having been sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein, telling People magazine that Weinstein pursued her in the mid '90s and then propositioned her in a hotel room while his then-wife, Eve Chilton, was in the room next door. Darcel, who starred in "The Stolen Children" and "Uranus" has also accused other French producers, including Jacques Dorfmann. In October, shortly after the accusations against Harvey Weinstein went public, French actress Isabelle Adjani published an op-ed in the weekly JDD newspaper saying, "(T)his is not a game … When an actress dresses up in a seductive way to get a role, it's not to get raped!" She went on to say that in France, "things are more sneaky" than in the US — but "seduction" cannot be an excuse for assault. Author: Courtney Tenz "The thinking of the authorities doesn't necessarily target the #MeToo movement. Everything that deviates from mainstream ideology or that involves power could be deleted." And while the Chinese government ostensibly supports fighting sexual harassment, when a cause gains too much publicity or threatens to create a larger social movement, it is inevitably censored by authorities. The detention of the "Feminist Five" in 2015 for handing out stickers to raise awareness about sexual harassment, and the strengthening of the Communist Party's information control apparatus means that the possibility of a mass women's rights movement gaining momentum in China appears more complicated when compared with the US and elsewhere. But there is room for optimism. Focus on victim, not perpetrator Official Communist Party doctrine addresses women's rights in the form of the official organization, the All-China Women's Federation, which was launched in 1949 when the People's Republic of China was established. At the time, Party Chairman Mao Zedong professed that women "hold up half the sky." "The #MeToo movement in China already has a far bigger impact than I expected," said Xiao, adding that activists wanted to establish mechanisms and enable more people to participate in the discussion and expand the movement's reach. "In the West, the #MeToo movement has exposed men in fields including entertainment, politics and business. It is hardly possible in China, as there is too much at stake in these areas. I put my hopes on women who work for private companies to take more action," added Xiao. As with online social activists and human rights bloggers in China, the nascent Chinese #MeToo movement will encounter increasingly broader and more aggressive government censorship as it develops the potential to be a larger social force. Huang explained that Chinese women (when they are not the victims) are brave to express their opinion and condemn sexual harassment. However, very few victims dare to report these cases with their real names as sexual harassment will be analyzed in detail and the victim might even be questioned and not believed by some people because she is not the "perfect" victim. "The traditional patriarchal hierarchy is a hotbed of sexual assault and sexual harassment," said Xiao, adding that people shift their focus to the victims, and society lacks relevant laws and often looks for the source of the problem among victims. "The ones who seek to break silence deal with a sense of shame, and the perpetrators aren't afraid. It is a vicious circle." Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
