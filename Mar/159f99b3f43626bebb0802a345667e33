Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman described the events at a news conference announcing the charges, saying that Noor acted "recklessly and intentionally" when firing his gun.

Noor has reportedly refused to cooperate with investigators. In response to the murder charge, his lawyer Tom Plunkett argued that prosecutor Freeman had jumped to conclusions on the case. "The facts will show that Officer Noor acted as he has been trained and consistent with established departmental policy. Officer Noor should not have been charged with any crime," attorney Plunkett said in a statement. Justine Damond Ruszczyk Domestic and international controversy The shooting was condemned in Minnesota and also in Australia, where local officials and Damond Ruszczyk's family demanded answers. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called the events "shocking" and "inexplicable." Then-Minneapolis police chief Janee Harteau had to resign over her handling of the case. City officials decried that procedures had been violated, as many questioned why the officers did not have their body cameras on at the moment of the incident. The victim's fiancé, Don Damond, and her father, John Ruszczyk, issued a joint statement in response to the murder charges, which they saw as "one step toward justice for this iniquitous act." They praised the decision and hoped that it would result in a conviction. "No charges can bring our Justine back. However, justice demands accountability for those responsible for recklessly killing the fellow citizens they are sworn to protect," they said in the statement.

After the shooting, the community feared possible reprisals. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey expressed his support to both the victim's family and the Somali community. "Our city stands firmly with our Somali community and against those leveling blame on our beloved neighbors," the mayor said. Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that the Minnesota Somali community supported the charges leveled against Noor. Hussain added that he hoped the charges were based on the "heinousness of the crime" and not on officer Mohamed Noor's ethnicity. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
