Myanmar President Htin Kyaw resigned on Wednesday, according to a statement from his office which said the leader was retiring. Parliament must now elect a new president within seven days, as directed by the constitution of Myanmar. In 2016, the 71-year-old Htin Kyaw became the first civilian president in more than five decades to be elected through free and fair elections and without ties to the military. Kyaw is an ally of Myanmar's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who holds the title of state counsellor and is barred from the presidency. cw,jcg /se (AFP, dpa)
