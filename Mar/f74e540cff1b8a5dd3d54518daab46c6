Local media has reported that as many as 50 witnesses, including former choirboys, are expected to provide evidence.

Most senior Vatican official to be charged Magistrate Belinda Wallington, who is presiding over the hearing, will decide whether to dismiss the charges or whether Pell's case should proceed to a criminal trial in a higher court. Even if she decides the evidence is not sufficient to proceed, public prosecutors can still move to take Pell to trial. Pell is the most senior Vatican official ever to be charged with sexual abuse. The 76-year-old has consistently denied the allegations against him and is expected to plead not guilty. The case also puts Pope Francis in a precarious situation. He promised a "zero tolerance" policy for sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church, but appointed Pell to the finance chief post despite criticism from victim advocacy groups.
