David Hogg, a survivor from the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSD) in Parkland, Florida, told the crowd of protesters in Washington, "if you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking." Hogg, who has emerged as one of the leaders of the student movement, added: "We will get rid of these public servants who only care about the gun lobby." The granddaughter of infamous civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. also made a rousing speech at the Washington rally. "My grandfather had a dream that his four little children will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character," nine-year-old Yolanda Renee King told the roaring crowd. "I have a dream that enough is enough. And that this should be a gun-free world — period." Martin Luther King's granddaughter, Yolanda Renee King, was joined on the March For Our Lives stage in Washington DC by MSD shooting survivor Jaclyn Corin Musicians  Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the hit musical "Hamilton," all performed on the stage set up in front of the US Capitol building. In New York, tens of thousands held a moment of silence to honor the dead before Sam Hendler, a 16-year-old student from MSD, read the names of the 17 victims.

I want to see change." Over 20,000 people filled a park near MSD in Parkland, Florida, on Saturday morning, where students chanted "enough is enough" and held up signs with slogans such as "our ballots will stop bullets." Protesters talk to Deutsche Welle Deutsche Welle's Michael Knigge was in Washington for the rally. A 14-year-old named Christopher from Boston told him that he knew five people who had lost their lives to gun violence in the past year. Dan, a 67-year-old from Virginia, told DW that he protested against the Vietnam War as a young man and compared the anti-war movement of the 1960s and 70s to the struggle against gun violence today. "In Vietnam, we shot at someone else, now we are shooting each other," he said, adding that he hoped he wouldn't have to come back for another march next year. Becky, a 26-old-year Philadelphia native who now lives in Washington, told DW: "I am an outraged citizen. I had a bullet come through my window in my apartment not long ago." Outside there were 54 rounds fired. Asked what should be done about gun violence, Becky said: "We have to cut the funding to the National Rifle Association (NRA) off. I am sick and tired of the tolerance we have for guns and gun violence in this country."

White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said "keeping our children safe is a top priority" of President Donald Trump, adding that the administration was pushing Congress to pass legislation that would expand background checks and supposedly improve school safety. Trump, meanwhile, had so far remained silent on the issue as he made his way to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for the weekend. Shortly after the  Florida shooting, the president indicated he would be open to arming teachers as a way to combat gun violence in schools. That measure, however, has drawn a lot of rebuke. Read more: European gun-makers flood the US with firearms From Arizona to Washington DC, students have walked out of classrooms to protest gun violence after the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Seventeen students were killed when a former student walked onto the premises and opened fire using an AR-15 rifle. Many of the students held signs reading "Never again" and "End gun violence." Teenagers at some of the schools called for the AR-15 and similar assault rifles to be banned for civilian use, saying they should be reserved for the armed forces. Others called for stricter measures to acquire arms. "Innocent people are dying because of the easy access to firearms in this country," said one student. Over the past decade, the US has witnessed several deadly mass shootings, including in Las Vegas, Orlando and Sandy Hook. Many students view the Parkland shooting as part of inaction by lawmakers to curb access to guns. "They send out their thoughts and their prayers, and we appreciate that, but that's enough," said one student. "We need change." But not all educators were supportive of the students. "Life is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative," said Superintendent Curtis Rhodes of Texas' Needville Independent School District. "We will discipline no matter if it is one, 50 or 500 students involved." ls/sms (AP, AFP) Poll: Americans want tighter gun laws A poll conducted by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, published to coincide with the March For Our Lives rallies, found that 69 percent of US citizens think gun laws in the country should be tightened. That figure is up from 61 percent who said the same in 2016 and 55 percent when the survey was first carried out in 2013. Read more: Guns and Wall Street — a match made in heaven? The poll also showed that 90 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of Republicans favor stricter gun control laws. What has been done this the Parkland shooting? In the aftermath of the shooting at MSD in Parkland last month, Florida passed a law raising the legal age for purchasing rifles. The NRA went on to sue the state of Florida, arguing the measure was unconstitutional. Trump initially said he supported raising the minimum age for gun purchases but later backed away from the measure. The White House explained the move, saying the president wanted to focus on legislation that could get through Congress. Several major companies have cut ties with the NRA in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting, including US airlines United and Delta and car rental firms Hertz and Enterprise. Chains such as Walmart also announced that they would impose new restrictions on gun sales. The NRA shot back at the companies, accusing them in a statement of displaying a "shameful display of political and civic cowardice." Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
