Two Spanish skiers were killed on Saturday when an avalanche hit a group skiing off-piste on a mountain in southwestern France, near the Aragnouet-Bielsa tunnel which links France to Spain. Three other members of the group managed to alert authorities after their companions went missing just before midday (1100 GMT). Around 20 rescuers were deployed in the area, along with dogs and two helicopters, said authorities. One man was found dead in the snow by rescuers, while the other was discovered alive by a rescue dog. He died later in a Toulouse hospital.
