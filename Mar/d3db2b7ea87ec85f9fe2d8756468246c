"We consider this attack as a serious challenge to our security and European sovereignty so it calls for a coordinated and determined response from the EU and its member states," Macron said. Merkel said EU member states would debate what measures to take "and then act." EU members decided at the summit to recall their ambassador to Russia with President of the European Council Donald Tusk saying: "Additional steps are expected as early as Monday at the national level."

Merkel said she expected an agreement on a European asylum system and progress on fundamental reforms in the Eurozone at the EU summit in June. The goal is to give Europe "new impetus," she said. The June summit will focus on a joint roadmap to strengthen the euro that is being worked on in in April and May.

"The EU must be united and determined ... if we are attacked we will react without weakness," he said. The EU has a temporary exemption from the steel and aluminum tariffs until May 1. Macron also advised entering into trade agreements with any countries that are not members of the Paris Climate Change Treaty. Merkel defended Germany's trade surpluses and it was important to avoid a "spiral of trade measures" between the EU and the US. "We are interested in fair international multilateral trade and will continue to speak out against protectionism."

Now we have to negotiate "a very intensive free trade agreement" with London. "We will not let ourselves be divided here." Macron warned London it could not carve up the EU's single market. "The single market cannot be divided up. There is not a choice of which sectors you sign up to. Once you are outside the single market, you're outside of it entirely."
