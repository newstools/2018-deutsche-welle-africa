German Chancellor Angela Merkel will travel to Warsaw on Monday for talks with Polish leaders aimed at improving relations which have been strained by disagreements on rule of law, immigration and refugee policy, Poland's new Holocaust law, as well as a new gas pipeline. On her second foreign trip since being sworn in for a fourth term as chancellor, Merkel will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Polish government spokeswoman Joanna Kopcinska said Warsaw hoped for "a good and pragmatic cooperation with Berlin." Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

She'll have to balance between enlisting Poland's help with backing the EU while also being firm on EU core principles that have been challenged by Poland's sweeping judicial reforms. Both Brussels and Berlin say Warsaw's reforms are an attack on the independence of the judiciary. The Polish government, however, maintains that the reforms are necessary to root out corruption. The Polish government has also come under fire for passing a new law that bans certain statements about the Holocaust, which critics say amounts to a denial of the actions of some Poles during the Holocaust.

Warsaw has also criticized the planned "Nord Stream 2" gas pipeline, which will be routed from Russia to Germany, but bypass Poland and Ukraine. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

Both foreign ministers called for the revival of the Weimar Triangle, a political cooperation platform between Poland, Germany and France. Their last meeting was in 2016. Ties between Germany and Poland became particularly strained after the Polish nationalist, conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) came to power in 2015. There are also concerns that the rise of far-right, anti-migrant parties in Austria and Italy could contribute to a rift between Brussels and central European countries. rs/kl (dpa, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
