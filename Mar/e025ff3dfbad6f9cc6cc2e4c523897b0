Russia said on Sunday it had successfully test-fired a hypersonic missile, one of a range of next-generation weapons unveiled by President Vladimir Putin in his state-of-the-nation address earlier this month. The country's defense ministry released video footage that showed the high-precision Kinzhal missile detaching from a MiG-31 supersonic fighter jet and darting across the dark sky, leaving a fiery trail behind. "The launch went according to plan, the hypersonic missile hit its target," the ministry added. 'Ideal weapon' The Kinzhal — the name means a double-edged Russian dagger — was described as "an ideal weapon" by Putin during the missile's unveiling on March 1. Putin, who is widely expected to be re-elected as Russia's president later this month, claimed the missile that flies at 10 times the speed of the sound cannot be intercepted by air-defense systems.
