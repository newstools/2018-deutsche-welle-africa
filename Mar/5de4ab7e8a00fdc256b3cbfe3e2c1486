Lawmakers in Malaysia are set to consider a tough new bill on media on Monday, with the proposed law aimed at cracking down on "fake news" with long prison terms and hefty fines for the offenders. The law would also apply to foreigners operating outside Malaysian borders as long as citizens of the country were affected by the reports. The government-drafted bill defines fake news as "any news, information, data and reports which is, or are, wholly or partly false whether in the form of features, visuals or audio recordings or in any other form capable of suggesting words or ideas." It also foresees jail terms of up to 10-years and fines of up to 500,000 ringgit ($128,331, €103,593) for people who create and publish such reports.

"It is timed for the elections and to silence discussions on 1MDB," he said. The law is set to pass several reading in the government-controlled parliament before the vote. Responding to the criticism, Malaysia's environmental minister, Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar, insisted the law "will not be abused." "It is not aimed at silencing critics," he said. Other governments in the South Asian region, including Singapore and the Philippines, have already proposed similar laws. dj/kms (AP, AFP, Reuters)
