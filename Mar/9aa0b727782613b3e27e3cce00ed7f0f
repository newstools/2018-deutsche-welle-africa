Authorities in the German state of Hesse announced on Friday that they had identified four suspected members of the radical "Reichsbürger" group, roughly translated as "Citizens of the Reich." One of the suspects was employed as a temporary worker at a school while another worked at Hesse's Culture Ministry. The school worker has since been dismissed while the civil servant faces disciplinary proceedings, according to local reports.

The Reichsbürger movement refuses to recognize the modern-day Federal Republic of Germany. It instead subscribes to the idea that the 1937 borders of the German Empire still exist and that Germany today is an administrative construct occupied by the Western powers.

Of those: It's not the first time that Reichsbürger have been uncovered within the public sector. In October 2016, a police officer in Bavaria was suspended for his suspected ties to the movement, while Saxony's state premier announced the following month that there were three suspected members in the state's police force.

Around 900 have been identified as far-right extremists, while 1,000 have a license to bear firearms. While easily dismissed as crackpots, many Reichsbürger ascribe to right-wing, anti-Semitic and Nazi ideologies. The movement gained significant traction after a member shot dead a policeman in Bavaria in October 2016. In January, German news magazine Focus reported that the group was trying to build up an army ahead of what they dubbed to be a "day of reckoning." Reichsbürger translates to "citizens of the Reich." What unites this loose movement is rejection of the modern Federal Republic of Germany. They believe the 1937 or 1871 borders of the German Empire still exist and today's country is an administrative construct still occupied by the Allied powers. Many subscribe to far-right or anti-Semitic ideologies. Their conspiracy theories have been debunked. The Reichsbürger scene is a disparate, leaderless movement totalling about 15,000 supporters, according to German intelligence officials. Of those, about 900 have been identified as far-right extremists and 1,000 have a license to own firearms. Authorities are concerned about some members' potential to become violent and have conducted several raids on Reichsbürger suspects to sieze weapons. Adrian Ursache, a 42-year-old former winner of the Mister Germany beauty pageant, is also a Reichsbürger member. He is currently facing trial for attempted murder after an August 2016 gun battle with police as they tried to evict him from his home. Typically, Reichsbürger refuse to recognize any state apparatus, printing their own passports and driving licenses. The case of Wolfgang P., who in October 2017 was sentenced to life in prison for murdering a police officer, is seen as a turning point for how German authorities deal with the extremist group. P., an alleged Reichsbürger member, shot at officers who were raiding his home to confiscate weapons. German authorities have been accused of long underestimating the threat posed by the Reichsbürger. Since the murder of the police officer in Bavaria, law enforcement has been cracking down on them more vigorously. In the past year there have been several raids on Reichsbürger targets. Some German police and military forces have also probed whether they may have Reichsbürger among their own ranks.
