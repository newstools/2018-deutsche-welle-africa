The US warned at the UN on Monday that it would react to any chemical weapon attacks in Syria as it proposed a new 30-day-ceasefire in the rebel-held enclave of eastern Ghouta . "We also warn any nation that is determined to impose its will through chemical attacks and inhuman suffering, most especially the outlaw Syrian regime: The United States remains prepared to act if we must," Ambassador Nikki Haley told the UN Security Council. She reminded the council that President Donald Trump had ordered missile strikes against a Syrian government airbase in April 2017 after accusing forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad of using sarin gas against civilians.

"This is no ceasefire," she said, adding: "This is the Assad regime, Iran, and Russia continuing to wage war against their political opponents." Russia, she said, had conducted at least 20 daily bombing missions in Damascus and eastern Ghouta in the first four days of the truce. The US draft would see an immediate end to all hostilities in eastern Ghouta and nearby Damascus City for 30 days after its adoption to allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians, according to AFP news agency. The draft, in contrast to the earlier ceasefire, would not allow parties to continue fighting terrorist groups. Observers have accused Russia of exploiting a clause that allowed for anti-terrorism operations to continue fighting rebels in eastern Ghouta.

More than 1,100 civilians, including 241 children, have died in the fighting, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council fighting in the area had increased since February 24. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who said the Russian-backed operation in eastern Ghouta was part of a counterterrorism mission, criticized the US for "doing nothing but constantly blaming the Syrian regime and putting demands on Russia." Nebenzia said the earlier ceasefire was not designed to stop fighting immediately, but was instead a "preliminary agreement" for "sustained de-escalation in all difficult areas of Syria, not only eastern Ghouta." Read more: Eastern Ghouta tragedy pits neighbors against each other More than 500 people have been killed so far in one of the most ferocious attacks on eastern Ghouta near Damascus since the conflict began in 2011. President Bashar Assad's forces continued their assault on eastern Ghouta despite a UN resolution demanding a 30-day ceasefire, as well as a five-hour daily "pause" ordered by President Vladimir Putin, the Syrian regime's main ally. Referring to the Syrian regime's latest assault, which began on February 19, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres demanded "this hell on earth" be stopped immediately. Eastern Ghouta is one of the last rebel strongholds and is home to about 400,000 people, most of whom have been unable to flee. Damascus wants to gain territory, with the help of Russia, to secure its interests during peace talks. According to activists and doctors in the region, several people have suffered symptoms consistent with those triggered by a chlorine gas attack and had to be treated in hospital. French President Emmanuel Macron has warned the Syrian regime that the use of chemical weapons will result in French retaliation, but the Syrian government claims it has never used this kind of munition. A man and child look at the remains of a missile in the besieged settlement of Douma, the largest in eastern Ghouta. More than 300,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in 2011, when the government cracked down on protesters who were calling for the release of political prisoners and for President Bashar Assad to step down. Activists say people in Douma have little food or water. Marten Mylius, the emergency relief coordinator for CARE in the Middle East, told DW that "after the tunnels were destroyed and the crossings closed, the price of basic foods skyrocketed. One kilo of rice now costs $4.50 (€3.66). A lot of people cannot afford that anymore. In other words, we are witnessing a rapid spread of malnutrition." Aid access to eastern Ghouta is difficult because there is no direct route from neighboring countries. "In Idlib, for example...you can get in directly from the Turkish border. You can wait with supplies at the border and then bring in the convoy. It is much more difficult in eastern Ghouta because we have to negotiate with the Syrian regime and are at the mercy of its decisions," Mylius told DW. The UN Security Council unanimously demanded a 30-day ceasefire in Syria "without delay" on February 24. Drafted by Kuwait and Sweden, the resolution proposed a 30-day pause in fighting across the country to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered and people in need of emergency medical assistance to be evacuated. Russia insisted that the text not apply to the "Islamic State" group or al-Qaida. Author: Nicole Goebel France calls out Russia French Ambassador Francois Delattre said Russia could "stop the bloodbath" if it stopped its bombing campaign and convinced Assad to stop his offensive. "We all know that Russia has not been able or willing to stop this military offensive yet," he said. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said suffering in eastern Ghouta was becoming "more desperate by the day." According to him, not a single critically injured person had been evacuated since the February 24 ceasefire entered force. Read more: What foreign powers want from the Syrian war amp/kms (AFP, dpa)
