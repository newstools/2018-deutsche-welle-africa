UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd told the House of Commons on Thursday that enormous resources were being expended to figure out who was behind an attack on a former Russians spy and his daughter. Rudd called the use of a chemical nerve agent on British soil a "brazen and reckless" act that would be answered with all possible force. "This was attempted murder in the most cruel and public way," said Rudd of the attack on 66-year-old Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, 33. The two were found collapsed on a bench in the city of Salisbury and remain in hospital in stable but critical condition — as does the policeman who found them, who was also exposed to the substance. Rudd said the police officer was conscious and talking. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

"This is not a kitchen sink job," Richard Guthrie, a chemical weapons expert at the research organization CBW events, told the Associated Press. He added that the highly public nature of the attack seemed to be "an expression of power" and an attempt to send a message. Production of chemical agents is banned under a UN accord signed by all member states apart from Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan. While Guthrie said a nerve agent does not necessarily have to be produced by a government, it requires a highly sophisticated lab and an expert chemist. Guthrie said Moscow was "obviously a clear candidate" to have perpetrated the attack, but added the caveat that "it's also possible that there could be some troublemaker out there that wants to make it look like it was Russia." Skripal and his daughter Yulia, the last living member of his immediate family following the death of his wife and older son Skripal: Double agent freed by Moscow Authorities have determined, however, that the chemical agent is not VX — the compound that killed Kim Jong Nam, the brother of North Korean Kim Jong Un, in minutes in February 2017. Skripal was arrested in 2006 by Moscow for "high treason" after it emerged he may have turned into a double agent and sold state secrets to Britain. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison, but, in a rare move, the Kremlin agreed to a prisoner swap – trading Skripal and three others charged with espionage in exchange for the United States releasing 10 Russian. Since 2010, Skripal has led an uneventful life in the quiet city of Salisbury in the south of England. However, another Russian exile, Valery Morozov, told the British press that he had not completely given up espionage and did work in cyber-security. es/sms (AP, AFP, Reuters)
