A small group of eight men and women got together in 2015 in the Dresden suburb of Freital to send a signal with a bomb attack to refugees and the people who help and support them. Thank goodness no one was killed, but hatred and violence have become normal in Germany. Almost 2,000 refugees fell victim to racist violence in 2017. Refugee shelters are attacked almost daily. Now the Dresden Higher Regional Court has sentenced the members of the so-called "Freital Group" to four to 10 years in prison. And rightly so!

It also corrupts the most important lesson learned from the horrors of the Nazi regime, put into words in the German constitution, Article 1: "Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority." Human dignity, not German dignity. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp
