The United States imposed anti-dumping tariffs on imports of carbon and alloy steel wire rod from several European nations, Turkey and South Korea. Exporters in Italy, Spain, the UK and South Korea were accused of dumping carbon steel wire rod in the US, the Commerce Department said in a statement. It said those countries dumped the product at between 11 percent and 41 percent below fair value, Turkey as at much as about 8 percent less than fair value and Britain at 147.63 percent less than fair value.
