Trump wrote on Twitter: "Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy." He added: "Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy." McCabe said his ouster was part of Trump's "ongoing war on the FBI" and the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. He added: "This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort ... to taint the FBI, law enforcement and intelligence professionals more generally."

Trump's focus: Trump wrote on Twitter in December about McCabe's upcoming eligibility to retire with a full pension: "FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!"
