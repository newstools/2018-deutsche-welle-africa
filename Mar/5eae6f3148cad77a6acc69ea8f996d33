+++ Refresh page for live updates +++ Germany and Spain aren't the only big guns in action tonight. England, Argentina, France and reigning European champions Portugal are all playing too. Brazil defeated Russia 3-0 earlier on this evening thanks to goals from Miranda, Coutinho and Paulinho. 15 mins to go - Cap number 90 for the Raumdeuter! Germany XI - Jogi Löw names arguably his strongest side to face Spain and why not? The World Cup is almost upon us and it's time to get the players gelling. Manuel Neuer, still not up to full speed after breaking his foot at the end of last year, is not in the squad so Marc Andre Ter Stegen is between the sticks. The back line is about as fierce as it gets and, ahead of Toni Kroos and captain Sami Khedira, Mesut Özil is taksed with making things tick. Timo Werner leads the line with Julian Draxler and Thomas Müller on the flanks. Spain XI - The visitors clearly got the memo, as Julen Lopetegui names a world class side. The imperious David De Gea will be more than pleased with the calibre of his defenders and only Sergio Busquets is missing from an otherwise full-strength midfield. Valencia's Rodrigo is perhaps the only surprise inclusion. He starts up top. He's managed 13 in 24 starts this season, so he knows where the goal is. Who's excited?
