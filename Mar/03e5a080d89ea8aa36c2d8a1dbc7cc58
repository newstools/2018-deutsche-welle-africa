One in five children in Germany show indications of having psychological problems, according to a study released on Thursday by the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's pubic health body. Boys are more likely to have both emotional and behavioral problems than girls.

That is a similar percentage to numbers from more than a decade ago. Although overweight or obesity rates are high, researchers found it positive that the upward trend has stopped. At the same time, they say that the fact that the levels remain so high means there is no room for complacency. Nearly half of children who were overweight or obese as a child remained so in their teenage years, the study said. Children who are overweight or obese are also more likely to suffer from weight issues as an adult. They are also more likely to have long-term health problems and be bullied, according to the US Centers of Disease Control. Send  Facebook   Twitter   Google+   Whatsapp

Only 22.4 percent of girls and 29.4 percent of boys aged 3 to 17 years exercised 60 minutes daily, as recommended by the World Health Organization. Here again, the socio-economic status of families played a role. Children from socially disadvantaged families are significantly less active in sports. Smoking The study also found that adolescents who smoke are likely to continue to do so as adults. Only 15 percent were able to quit as adults. Smoking mothers have an impact on children's health. One in nine mothers with children aged 0-6 smoke. That is about a 50-percent drop from more than a decade ago.
