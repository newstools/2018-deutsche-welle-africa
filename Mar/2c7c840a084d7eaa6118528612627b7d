Some 8 million Cubans voted on Sunday to ratify the island's new National Assembly, paving the way for the selection of a new leader when President Raul Castro steps down next month. Just over 600 pre-selected candidates will be elected to parliament following Sunday's vote. The final results are due to be announced at 4 p.m. local time (2000 UTC). Voter turnout was just under 80 percent, according to Cuba's National Electoral Commission.

Raul Castro took over the presidency in 2006 from his ailing brother Fidel, who led Cuba for almost 50 years after seizing power during the 1959 revolution. Sunday's vote will be the first since Fidel died in 2016. Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel, a trained engineer who has risen up the party's ranks over some 30 years, is widely expected to take over. Outgoing President Raul Castro is expected to stay on as leader of the all-powerful Communist Party. Sunday's general election will also instigate a generational shift at the lower end of Cuban politics. Several analysts expect a number of revolutionaries currently seated in the parliament to also retire once Raul Castro steps down. Cuban Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel casts his ballot in an election likely to pave the way for him succeeding Raul Castro as the country's president The new leadership is unlikely to further embrace major new market reforms on the island. After casting his ballot on Sunday, Diaz-Canel took to state television to lambast the United States, accusing it of "resuming Cold War rhetoric." While not mentioning US President Donald Trump by name, the vice president said the current White House administration had "offended Cuba." "The revolution is being attacked in the middle of a situation which has been deteriorating," Diaz-Canel said. "I am sure that, sooner rather than later, we will defeat the imperialist plans." On Sunday, Cuba's Foreign Ministry tweeted: "The next president may not have that surname, but he will undoubtedly be a son of the Revolution."

After an upswing in relations with the United States under President Barack Obama, his successor, Donald Trump, has vowed to maintain Washington's decades-long trade embargo on its communist neighbor. Responding to Fidel Castro's death in 2016, Trump described the revolutionary leader as "a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people." Cuba also used to rely heavily on aid from ally Venezuela. However, a financial crisis and steep fall in living conditions there has seen those funds dry up. Diaz-Canel will therefore face a far stiffer test than his predecessors, and this will not be helped by his lacking the same moral authority enjoyed by the revolutionary Castro brothers. The incoming president will therefore have to earn his legitimacy in the eyes of the voters, by addressing their concerns and raising living standards. At the Paseo del Prado, beside the central square, hotels line the streets. El Capitolio, the seat of the government until the Cuban Revolution in 1959, has now become a place for social gatherings, where Cubans meet each other to exchange gossip and play games. Children have their first lesson in Cuban boxing during a training session at Rafael Trejo Boxing School in the Habana Vieja neighborhood. "The Cuban government made my dream to be a nurse and help people a reality," said Mirta Gomez, a retired nurse. Before the revolution, educational opportunities in Cuba were reserved for the elite. Once Castro came into power, Gomez was able to study nursing. She spent most of her career at Havana's Central Hospital. She still helps out and trains new nurses. Her new hobby is selling flowers. Across Havana, buildings are being renovated to make way for the return of American tourism. As the government authorizes certain private business, hotels and restaurants are leading the construction boom. This building will be a group of "casas particulieres," similar to a bed and breakfast, in the Vedado neighborhood. Cubans need to apply for a license to rent rooms in their homes to foreigners. Francisco Arrosa, 75, reads Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, as he waits for new clients. "We are socialists. What Fidel and the Revolution started, the Cuban people will keep," the car mechanic said. "We may not be wealthy, but every Cuban has access to food, education, healthcare, and housing. These things are the revolution." Tourists take photos from an old American car driving through Plaza Central. With the decades-long US embargo, vehicles from the 1950s and 1960s were the only option for Cubans for many years. Now, Korean, Chinese, and some European brands are entering the island's market. The old cars continue to be used as taxis or for tourism. Along one of Havana's most popular boardwalks, Cubans can check their e-mail or read government-approved websites. In 2015, the Cuban government opened the first public wi-fi hotspots in 35 public locations. However, the internet is one of the most censored in the world and essentially unavailable in private homes. Canadians make up the largest percentage of Cuba's tourists, but with the resumption of flights and cruise ships from the US, the number of US visitors is expected to surge this year. As an island nation, fishing plays an important role in Cuban culture, including in its cuisine. Generation after generation have made their livelihood on the practice and fish is one of Cuba's biggest exports. US tourism companies already have their eyes on the country's pristine coastal waters. Author: Mauro Pimentel, Kait Bolongaro Voting in communist Cuba The National Assembly vote, held every five years, is unique among the small handful of communist-run states —something that gives the Cuban government a sense of democratic legitimacy. Although candidates are not required to be members of the Communist Party, Cuba's only legal party, a vast majority are. "The designation of candidates is based on merit, abilities and the commitment of the people," Raul Castro said when he announced the elections last year. The Cuban Communist Party's official daily, Granma, wrote ahead of the vote: "Nobody exchanges promises for votes, or boasts of his abilities to get supporters ... this is the true and exceptional face of what we proudly call socialist democracy." Voters on Sunday ratified candidates from two separate lists — one for the 605-seat National Assembly and the other for the 14 provincial assemblies. While opposition is limited, criticisms center mainly on the presidential selection and the fact that the leader is not elected through a direct public ballot.
