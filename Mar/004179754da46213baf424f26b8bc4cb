Net migration to Germany fell by more than half from 2015 to 2016, figures released on Tuesday by the German Federal Statistics Office show. Altogether 1,865,000 people came to Germany in 2016, while 1,365,000 left, which equals a net migration figure of 500,000. That is down from 1,140,000 the year before, at the height of the refugee crisis. The office said this reduction was partly due to the closing of the Balkan route to migrants seeking to come to Europe. Net migration of people with non-German passports reached 635,000, down from 1,157,000 in 2015, while some 135,000 more Germans left the country than returned.
