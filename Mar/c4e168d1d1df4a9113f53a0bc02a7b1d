The EU Commission is preparing itself for the worst-case scenario, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in discussions last week. He is particularly concerned about the outcome of the Italian parliamentary elections, in particular that Italy may "not get an effective government" due to an unclear majority structure. Juncker even brandished the specter of financial market turmoil, although he later said that he had been misunderstood. He cited the SPD members' vote as a further reason for his concern: Without the SPD members' agreement, there will be no grand coalition and therefore no government for Europe's leading power.

In her most recent government statement on European policy last week, she said, "We need a new start for Europe." This was even outlined in the coalition agreement. 2018 is the year in which the foundations for the future must be laid. But she is still only making such statements as the acting chancellor. She gave the impression, after the recent EU special summit, that European partners are now expecting German politics to deliver a stable government. This was a clear solicitation to SPD members to agree to forming a coalition with the conservative Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU). Will panic break out in Brussels if no grand coalition is formed Berlin? According to Janis Emmanouilidis, of the Brussels-based think tank European Policy Center, this is not the case. However, Emmanouilidis believes it would produce "a sense of uncertainty, since one of the strongest players would not have a government able to make serious decisions." That is why Brussels is hoping very much that a grand coalition will be formed, he says.

A few years ago, the American news magazine Time named her "Frau Europa." When Trump became US president, some English-language media styled her as the leader of the entire Western world. That is in the past. At the end of last year Time named French President Emmanuel Macron as the "next leader of Europe." While Merkel's party lost a lot of support in the German election, Macron emerged as the big winner of the French presidential election. And while Macron held receptions for the difficult presidents Trump, Putin and Erdogan, which he, in each case, mastered effortlessly, Merkel has spent the last six months in exploratory talks and coalition negotiations. According to Stefan Seidendorf, deputy director of the Franco-German Institute in Ludwigsburg, Macron has not superseded Merkel, but "he uses the Fifth Republic's instruments of power very strongly." He employs diplomacy or the military, for example, to emphasize France's influence in Europe and throughout the world, Seidendorf explains. On the European stage, for instance, he has presented reform proposals and called for a finance minister and a budget for the eurozone. In Germany, these moves have been viewed with skepticism, especially by the CDU/CSU. Once again Berlin has found itself on the defensive. The Free Democrats' (FDP) leader, Christian Lindner, is already bemoaning that while France has become the frontrunner, the German government has nothing better to offer than simply to echo ideas from Paris.

While Merkel has made her displeasure with Trump clear, Macron seems to find a way of dealing with him Leading position only together with France Janis Emmanoulidis says that if Merkel renews her chancellorship through forming a grand coalition, she "will continue to play a strong leading role in the future." Germany's importance remains unchanged, he says. "At the same time, there is a stronger balance between member states." Above all, the relationship between Germany and France is "more balanced today than it was a few years ago," Emmanoulidis believes. In addition to the resurgence of France under Macron, the long exploratory talks and coalition negotiations in Germany have also played a role, he says. As a result, "Berlin does not have the same strength as before." Even though the euro crisis has lessened, and there are now other challenges, Germany's weight is no longer "the same as before," says Emmanoulidis. He argues that, from a European perspective, this is "good news," because it will make it easier to implement common reforms.

The Visegrad states in eastern central Europe, made up of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, are not prepared to make any concessions whatsoever. This is especially the case with regard to refugee policy, which Merkel, in particular, has repeatedly demanded of them. And the next major disagreement could be about the EU budget. Merkel has already offered to cover part of the British EU payments that will be missing in future. In Germany, she has been accused of selling out. FDP leader Lindner said, "This has weakened the German negotiating position." Alice Weidel, parliamentary party leader of the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany party (AfD), said that for the Chancellor, "more responsibility for Europe" meant spending more money and foregoing national sovereignty. Speaking of AfD, at the moment about 20 percent of the seats at the European Parliament are held by right-wing populists. The moderate parties are afraid that there will be even more after the next European elections in May 2019. Until then, the Commission and member states' governments want to offer citizens concrete solutions to their problems, so that they have no reason to vote for the right. There is already a short time frame in which to be able to achieve this. If Germany's Social Democratic Party members say no to the grand coalition and new elections have to be held, it would probably take another six months. This is precious time in which the leadership of Germany — Europe's economic powerhouse and its most populous country — would not be involved in shaping any future course. This would leave barely any time to take action. There are five "classic ministries" in Germany's government – Finance, Foreign, Interior, Justice and Defense. Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) are ceding direct control of two of them. One, finance, is to change from right to left of the political divide, moving from CDU to Social Democrat (SPD) hands. Other switches are likely in less prominent portfolios. The transfer of the Finance Ministry from CDU hands to the SPD is the biggest surprise of the deal. The minister plays a major role at the European level as evidenced by the CDU’s Wolfgang Schäuble during the eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Hamburg Mayor Olaf Scholz, a centrist within the SPD, will likely get the title of deputy chancellor in addition to finance minister. The Interior Ministry, which deals with law and order within Germany, looks set to stay in the hands of Merkel’s conservatives, but not her own CDU. Touted for the position is the leader of Bavarian sister party the CSU, Horst Seehofer (left). The Bavarian party has taken a tougher line than Merkel on immigration. The conservatives suffered losses to the far-right AfD in September's election. Under the deal, the SPD will keep control of the Foreign Ministry. Since 1966, the ministry has been run by a member of smaller coalition partners. Sigmar Gabriel has been in the role in a caretaker capacity since Frank-Walter Steinmeier was elected president. Martin Schulz (above), a former leader of the European Parliament, was expected to take over but pulled out in a bid to quell party unrest. The CDU’s Ursula von der Leyen, a key ally of Merkel who is thought to have her own ambitions to become chancellor, is likely to remain in her role at the helm of the Defense Ministry. The ministry has had a growing importance in recent decades as Germany became more involved in foreign military operations. In particular, the Bundeswehr maintains a significant deployment of troops in Afghanistan. Typically a portfolio that goes to the junior coalition partner, responsibility for the Justice Ministry may well stay with the current incumbent — the SPD’s Heiko Maas. While individual states in Germany are generally responsible for the administration of justice, the federal ministry is charged with making and changing constitution-related laws. It also analyzes laws made by other ministries. Helping to make up for the CDU losing two major offices, the CDU will get its hands on the Economy Ministry, also responsible for energy policy. Merkel's right hand in the chancellery Peter Altmaier (pictured) — who has also been running the Finance Ministry since the departure of Wolfgang Schäuble — is expected to take over from the SPD's Brigitte Zypries. The favorite to take over at the top of the Ministry of Agriculture is the CDU’s Julia Klöckner, who leads the party in the western state of Rhineland Palatinate. Having twice failed in her bid to become state premier there, she'll be one of the relatively rare new faces in Berlin. The CSU will also retain the Transport Ministry with CSU Secretary-General Andreas Scheuer, from Lower Bavaria, taking charge. He’d also be responsible for digital infrastructure. The party will hold onto the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, with undersecretary in the Transport Ministry Dorothee Bär set to take the reins from current Development Minister Gerd Müller. The Health Ministry remains a CDU concern, with Annette Widmann-Mauz, an undersecretary in the ministry from Baden Württemberg, expected to take over. She’d replace fellow CDU member Hermann Gröhe, who is touted to head up the Federal Ministry for Education and Research. Author: Richard Connor
