Turkish troops and allied Syrian opposition fighters encircled the Kurdish-held town of Afrin on Tuesday. Afrin, located in Syrian territory, has been the target of an Ankara-led offensive for seven weeks. In a brief statement, the Turkish military said that the new siege on Afrin had begun on Monday, adding that it had taken control of "critical areas" of the town without giving further details. Earlier on Monday, Turkey's army asserted that it had taken control over half of the area under rebel control.
