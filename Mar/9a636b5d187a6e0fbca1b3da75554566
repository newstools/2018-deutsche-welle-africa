Sir Simon Rattle has been named honorary conductor of Germany's National Youth Orchestra (BJO), a position that will allow him to maintain an active connection to the country's music scene after his final appearance as the Berlin Philharmonic's music director on June 20. The British conductor, 63, has regularly worked with the youth orchestra ever since the Berlin Philharmonic became the BJO's official sponsor in 2013, occasionally leading joint appearances of both orchestras.
