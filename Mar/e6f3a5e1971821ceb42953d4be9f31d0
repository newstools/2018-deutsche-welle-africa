Thousands of Syrians fled the eastern Ghouta suburb of Damascus on Thursday, as the army captured more key opposition-held pockets. Syrian state television showed thousands of civilians carrying plastic bags filled with clothes as they fled Hammuriyeh and Jisreen, hours after the two towns were captured by government forces. With some 12,500 people evacuated the town into government-held territory, Thursday's exodus marks the largest outflow of civilians from Eastern Ghouta since it came under government siege in 2013.

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces now control over 70 percent of the eastern Ghouta enclave. After stepping up its onslaught on the region around month ago, Syrian troops have: Read more: Eastern Ghouta tragedy pits neighbors against each other At least '800 people fleeing every hour' Abdel-Rahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory said that Thursday marked the "largest exodus from the region since it fell under government siege." Russian military general Vladimir Zolotukhin was quoted as saying that "every hour, over 800 people are leaving." On the ground, a Syrian officer in government-held territory said he welcomed the fleeing civilians from eastern Ghouta. "Praise God...the families are coming out to suitable locations to the state's embrace," he said. More than 500 people have been killed so far in one of the most ferocious attacks on eastern Ghouta near Damascus since the conflict began in 2011. President Bashar Assad's forces continued their assault on eastern Ghouta despite a UN resolution demanding a 30-day ceasefire, as well as a five-hour daily "pause" ordered by President Vladimir Putin, the Syrian regime's main ally. Referring to the Syrian regime's latest assault, which began on February 19, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres demanded "this hell on earth" be stopped immediately. Eastern Ghouta is one of the last rebel strongholds and is home to about 400,000 people, most of whom have been unable to flee. Damascus wants to gain territory, with the help of Russia, to secure its interests during peace talks. According to activists and doctors in the region, several people have suffered symptoms consistent with those triggered by a chlorine gas attack and had to be treated in hospital. French President Emmanuel Macron has warned the Syrian regime that the use of chemical weapons will result in French retaliation, but the Syrian government claims it has never used this kind of munition.

More than 300,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in 2011, when the government cracked down on protesters who were calling for the release of political prisoners and for President Bashar Assad to step down. Activists say people in Douma have little food or water. Marten Mylius, the emergency relief coordinator for CARE in the Middle East, told DW that "after the tunnels were destroyed and the crossings closed, the price of basic foods skyrocketed. One kilo of rice now costs $4.50 (€3.66). A lot of people cannot afford that anymore. In other words, we are witnessing a rapid spread of malnutrition." Aid access to eastern Ghouta is difficult because there is no direct route from neighboring countries. "In Idlib, for example...you can get in directly from the Turkish border. You can wait with supplies at the border and then bring in the convoy. It is much more difficult in eastern Ghouta because we have to negotiate with the Syrian regime and are at the mercy of its decisions," Mylius told DW. The UN Security Council unanimously demanded a 30-day ceasefire in Syria "without delay" on February 24. Drafted by Kuwait and Sweden, the resolution proposed a 30-day pause in fighting across the country to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered and people in need of emergency medical assistance to be evacuated. Russia insisted that the text not apply to the "Islamic State" group or al-Qaida.

On Thursday, a 25-truck convoy entered the isolated town of Douma with food supplies for some 26,000 hunger-stricken residents.  "This is just a little of what these families need," said the International Committee of the Red Cross, one of the bodies organizing aid deliveries to the region. Earlier this week, sick residents from Douma were allowed to evacuate to Damascus to receive medical treatment. 'Hell on Earth': The United Nations has made repeated demands for the Syrian government to halt its brutal advance into eastern Ghouta, describing the region as "hell of Earth." However, those demands have fallen on deaf ears, as Assad appears committed to rooting out all rebel forces from the region, which sits just to the east of Damascus.
