Thieves stole $5 million (€4 million) in cash from a Lufthansa airplane at freight airport near the city of Sao Paulo, Brazilian police said late on Monday. Authorities are yet to arrest anyone in connection with the robbery, which occurred the day before. The Lufthansa plane was stopping over at Viracopos airport when the incident occured What happened: Brazilian problem: Freight theft has risen in recent years in Brazil, particularly in and around the city of Rio de Janeiro. Most thieves have however targeted semi-trucks rather than airplanes. A criminal gang dug a 600-meter (2000-foot) tunnel in an attempt to rob 1 billion reais ($318 million, €270 million) from a bank. They were thwarted by police shortly before completing the heist. The tunnel entrance was in a nook in a rental house. The 16 participants pooled their money to pay for the tunnel, reaching about $1.27 million, police alleged. The tunnel was accessed through a 2 meter-deep ladder. The tunnel itself was about 1.5 meters high, was reinforced with iron beams and wood and lined with plastic, and was even wired with lights. The rental house was filled with food, water, special clothing and digging tools. The gang had spent four months digging the tunnel. Police arrested the gang members and a court ruled they should be held ahead of their trial. amp/rt (AFP, Interfax) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
