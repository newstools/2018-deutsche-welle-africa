Immigration by Jews to Israel rose by 5 percent over the past year, with 29,600 people moving to the country in 2018, according to figures released on Sunday by the state immigration organization "Jewish Agency for Israel." More than 10,500 of the Jewish immigrants came from Russia, the agency said, an increase of some 45 percent over 2017. In contrast, immigration from Russia's neighbor, Ukraine, went down by 9 percent to 6,500. Argentina saw a spike of 17 percent more Jews relocating to Israel, though the number of immigrants coming from the country was far more modest at 330. The number of immigrants coming from the US and Canada remained stable at 3,500, while immigration from France dropped 25 percent to 2,660 people. Just 660 came from the UK and 330 from Brazil, a drop of 4 percent in each case.
