An American man suspected of espionage was arrested in Moscow on December 28, Russia's domestic security service (FSB) said in a statement on Monday. The FSB said the man was caught "during an espionage operation" without giving further details. A criminal case has been opened against him under Article 276 of the Russian Criminal Code, which allows for prison sentences of up to 20 years. The state-run TASS news agency identified the man as Paul Whelan. The US Embassy in Moscow could not immediately be reached for comment. Russia has been entangled in multiple spy scandals in the West. Russian agents are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England. A Russian national, Maria Butina, was also convicted in the United States for acting as an illegal foreign agent. Tensions between Moscow and Washington have intensified since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Since then, the US and other countries have imposed various sanctions against Russian officials, companies and banks. The US is also investigating whether Russia interfered in US elections in 2016.
