From 1876 until the end of the current season there have been 2,694 performances at the Bayreuth Festival, all Wagner. This past summer's 32 performances were sold out, with over 62,000 visitors from numerous countries in attendance. Notable this year: the Bayreuth debut of Polish tenor Piotr Beczala in the title role, and the last appearance there of Waltraud Meier, returning to Bayreuth after an eighteen year absence. Highly stylized, mythical costumes in a charming setting and intense interaction of the protagonists characterize this production The stage direction brought out a twist on the plot in Act Three. When Elsa starts to ask uncomfortable questions in the wedding chamber, her husband sings of love but ties her up with an electric cord. Only when she asks him the forbidden question point blank is she able to free herself. At the end, Elsa and Ortrud are supposed to fall dead as the cataclysmically sad music plays. But in fact director Yuval Sharon has everyone else collapse instead as Ortrud, Elsa and her revived brother Gottfried remain standing. The strong women survive, apparently to develop a new order. It was seen as a timely message in the #MeToo era.
