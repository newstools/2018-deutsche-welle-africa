Venezuela's daily El Nacional will completely halt its print edition on Thursday, its editors said, blaming the move on pressure from the government. El Nacional was the last opposition newspaper still maintaining a nationwide circulation in Venezuela. "We've endured longer than the others," El Nacional's president and CEO Miguel Otero told the Spanish newspaper ABC. "But in the end we could not persist." The popular daily would continue publishing news online.

In Venezuela, importing paper requires a special permission by the government. Several smaller newspapers have already been forced to suspend print.

However, the paper has already cut its circulation and the number of pages. Miguel Otero told the ABC that his paper was also hit by government-backed lawsuits, tax reviews, and ad restrictions. Otero himself was forced to leave Venezuela years ago to avoid persecution.

Separately, the paper's general manager Jorge Makriniotis pledged to continue working in a letter sent to employees and published on El Nacional's website. "El Nacional has not died but is reinvented to bet on the future," Makriniotis said. "Because nobody is going to shut us up." dj/bw (AP, EFE)
