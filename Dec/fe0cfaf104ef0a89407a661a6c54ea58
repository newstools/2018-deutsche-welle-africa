Germany is launching an online site for victims to report anti-Semitic attacks, Felix Klein, Germany's commissioner for Jewish affairs, said Thursday. Starting in February, a platform run by the federal Research and Information Center for Anti-Semitism (RAIS) will take accounts of anti-Semitic incidents from victims and witnesses regardless of whether they were criminal in nature.

He called upon German society to help prevent hatred towards Jews. The reporting center will receive start-up funding of €243,000 ($278,320) in funds from 2019 and will be supported in the long-term by funds from Germany's Ministry for Family Affairs. The project intends to find partners in Germany's 16 states to help victims of anti-Semitism. Federal infrastructure to that end will be set up in Bavaria, Brandenburg and North Rhine-Westphalia next year. Better picture of anti-Semitism German authorities counted 1,075 crimes with an anti-Semitic background in the first nine months of 2018, according to the German Interior Ministry.

He said the initiative will be able to provide information of the development of anti-Semitism in Germany. RIAS head Benjamin Steinitz said targeted hatred of Jews in Germany is an increasing problem. He said the RIAS office in Berlin currently records two to three cases per day. He assumes that there is a "considerably higher number of unreported cases" and said the reporting office "could shed light on the large dark field of anti-Semitic incidents and crimes."
