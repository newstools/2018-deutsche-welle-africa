Flights at London's Gatwick Airport were halted again Friday evening due to a suspected drone flying near the area. "Gatwick is investigating reports of a drone sighting. As a precaution we have suspended airfield operations," the airport said on Twitter. The shutdown came less than a day after London's second-busiest airport resumed operations on Friday morning, after flights were canceled for more than 30 hours when two drones were spotted near the airfield.

More than 120,000 passengers were affected. Police described the drones as "unusually large" and said they may be operated deliberately in a bid to disrupt the airport at one of the busiest times of year. Hundreds of flights were canceled, delayed or diverted for a 36-hour period starting late Wednesday cw/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)
