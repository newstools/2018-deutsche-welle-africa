Police in the western German town of Sankt Augustin found the body in a shelter that houses both asylum-seekers and homeless people on Sunday evening after an extensive search of the area. Police had earlier located her clothes and handbag on the banks of a lake near the asylum center. The parents had reported the girl, who is from nearby Unkel, missing on Friday. Local media report that she told her parents she would meet a female friend in Bonn. Police say, however, that she went to see the suspect in the shelter instead. Quoting a police spokesman, Bonn's biggest daily, the General-Anzeiger, as well as regional broadcaster WDR reported that the 19-year-old man taken into custody is a German national, who also holds a Kenyan passport. We are continually updating the story as more details emerge.
