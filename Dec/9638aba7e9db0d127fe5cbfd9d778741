A Dutch court on Friday charged a 23-year-old for the stabbing murder of a US citizen after her body was found in a shared living space earlier this week. Responding to a call on Wednesday, police found Sarah Papenheim, a 21-year-old psychology student at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, dead in her apartment. The main suspect was arrested hours later at a train station in Eindhoven, more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of Rotterdam. The court said he will remain in custody pending investigation. According to Adam Pryor, a close friend of Papenheim, she had sent him messages expressing concern about her roommate, including one that said: "My roommate told me he's gonna kill 3 people." "I was concerned," Pryor told The Associated Press. "She said she was going to the police … It didn't feel like she was in danger."
