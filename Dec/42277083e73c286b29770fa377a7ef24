Gerst had been part of ISS expeditions 40 and 41 from May to November 2014, and went back up to the space station in June. Space station residents held a change-of-command ceremony with Gerst handing over to Oleg Kononenko of Roscosmos on Wednesday afternoon. The 42-year-old Gerst sent out a series of messages on Twitter, including lines by German-born American poet Charles Bukowski: "There is a place in the heart that will never be filled. A space." Gerst, born in Künzelsau, in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg, also included a message to his not-yet-born grandchildren. He apologized for the state of the planet and its resources left by his generation but told them how wonderful it was to be just three people on a spaceship looking at the millions on distant Earth below. "I will miss this place," he wrote.
