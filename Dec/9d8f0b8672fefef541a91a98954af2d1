"Just over 200 days ago, you, the people of Ireland, voted to repeal the 8th so we could care for women with compassion," Health Minister Simon Harris said on Twitter. "Today we have passed the law to make this a reality. A vote to end lonely journeys, end the stigma and support women's choices in our own country," he wrote. Some 170,000 Irish women have been forced to travel to neighboring Britain for abortions since 1980. While Ireland is a predominantly Catholic country, the influence of the Church has lessened in recent years.
