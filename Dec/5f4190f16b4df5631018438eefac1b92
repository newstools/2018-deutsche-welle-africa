The portal sold gas-powered pistols that fire high-velocity rubber bullets, crossbows, rubber ammunition and similar weapons. It also featured a ticker on sensationalist anti-immigrant stories.

"Protect yourself and your family," proclaimed the now-defunct site. According to the indictment, Mario R. sold the guns from Hungary to buyers in Germany between May and November 2016. The weapons were legal in Hungary but required a permit in Germany. Mario R. admitted to the crime, but maintained that he was not aware of German law. He can still appeal the verdict and was allowed to leave the court so long as he reports to police. The judge said that the defendant had used racist sentiments "in a particularly insidious way." He was arrested in Budapest in 2016 on a European arrest warrant. cw/aw (AFP, AP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
