We'll hear Gotthold Schwarz's baritone voice in two selections this hour. Otherwise, this program takes us to the center of the Bach universe: Leipzig, Germany, home of the Bach Archive, which scours the libraries of Saxony and beyond for historical sources on the life, times and performance practices of Johann Sebastian Bach and others. Now the Bachfest is led by one such musical scholar, Michael Maul. Michael Maul is the new director of the Bachfest The opening concert of the Bachfest 2018 includes one of the four "little masses" that the Protestant Bach may have written for the Catholic court in Dresden, where he held the mostly honorary title of "court composer." Also held high in Leipzig is the memory of another composer: Felix Mendelssohn. In 1829, 100 years after Bach wrote his St. Matthew Passion, Mendelssohn had it re-performed right here at St. Thomas' Church in Leipzig, starting a Bach revival that continues to the present day. We'll hear Mendelssohn's own setting of the hymn Verleih uns Frieden gnädiglich (Grant us peace graciously).
