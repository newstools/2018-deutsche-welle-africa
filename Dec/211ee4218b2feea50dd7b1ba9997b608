Are you among the people who get excited days before Christmas, and plan in detail how you will celebrate with your loved ones? Or do you belong to the category of people who view the whole thing as humbug? If you're among the latter, you're not alone. A survey found out that 15 per cent of all Germans see Christmas as the most stressful time of the year. Every year, the same kitsch decorations appear throughout the city, reminding people that they should get down to buying presents soon. On average, Germans spend €465 ($570) on gifts. And most of the time, the people receiving those presents do not really want or need any of those things. About 25 per cent of the people surveyed said that Christmas comes with too many expectations. Those who want to avoid the whole fuss might choose to keep working or take a holiday abroad — ideally somewhere warm. Many stars do the same thing. Check out our High Five gallery to find out which ones.
