The Electoral Commisison (CENI) in the Democratic Republic of Congo said on Thursday that the country's long-delayed presidential election will likely be postponed again. Set to take place on Sunday, the run-up to the vote had been marred by escalating violence. Presidential candidates were told at a meeting called by CENI Kinshasa that sectarian violence, a warehouse fire that destroyed vote counting machines in Kinshasa, and the risk of spreading an Ebola outbreak in the eastern part of the country were the key reasons the vote had to be pushed back again. The destruction vote counting machines in a fire prompted massive protests, particularly from students at Kinshasa University as the government has simultaneously clamped down on opposition rallies. The clampdown was partially orchestrated by Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, a former interior minister and President Joseph Kabila's hand-picked successor.
