"There were serious outstanding problems in Kabul that could hurt the fairness, transparency and inclusiveness of the election," said IECC spokesman Ali Reza Rohani. The finding must be upheld by the Afghan Independent Election Commission (IEC), which has overall authority over the ballot, More than a month after the vote, official results from the election have only been announced for only 14 of Afghanistan's 33 provinces, casting a shadow over the credibility of an election process that was marred by violence and allegations of fraud. More than one million votes were counted in Kabul, accounting for about a quarter of the around 4 million votes cast nationwide. The invalidation of votes in Kabul comes as Afghanistan prepares for presidential elections in April amid a deteriorating security situation, and nascent talks between the United States and Taliban to end the 17-year war. Election officials are considering delaying the presidential vote due organizational problems. cw/ng (dpa, Reuters)
