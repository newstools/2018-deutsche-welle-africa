Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says Washington is working on extraditing a US-based Muslim cleric accused of orchestrating a failed Turkish coup in 2016, the Reuters news agency and Turkish media reported on Sunday. Cavusoglu cited comments made by US President Donald Trump to his Turkish counterpart on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina earlier this month. Turkey has long sought the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, who is blamed by Turkish authorities for the failed putsch when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and helicopters, attacked parliament and shot unarmed civilians. Gulen has repeatedly denied any involvement in the failed putsch. Last month, Trump denied he was considering extraditing Gulen as part of a deal with the Ankara government to ease pressure over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul.
