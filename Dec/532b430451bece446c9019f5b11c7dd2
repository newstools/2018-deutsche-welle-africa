Libya's internationally-recognized unity government said on Tuesday that suicide bombers had targeted the Foreign Ministry in Tripoli, killing at least three people and injured six. Witnesses reported seeing plumes of smoke rising from the building. A thirdÂ bomber was reportedly neutralized by security forces before he could detonate his vest. Libya has been locked in conflict since 2011, when an uprising saw longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed. Since then, rivals factions and militias have engaged in both long-term and sporadic fighting. While there is now ostensibly one central government in Tripoli, Libya remains plagued by sectarian violence. The UN-recognized government is based in Tripoli, while another breakaway faction is based in Tobruk. There are also dozens of regional, religious and ethnic militias vying for power in different parts of the country. es/kms (AFP, Reuters)
