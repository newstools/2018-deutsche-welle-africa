Israeli police on Sunday recommended Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted in a corruption case involving the country's telecommunications giant Bezeq. Police said they have enough evidence to show Netanyahu and his wife Sara accepted bribes and committed fraud and breach of trust. What we know so far: Sara Netanyahu, the premier's wife, is already facing trial on suspicion of misusing state funds 'No moral mandate' The police's recommendation has triggered calls for Netanyahu to resign immediately. "The prime minister has no moral mandate to keep his seat and must resign today," said Tamar Zandberg, who leads the leftwing Meretz party. "Israel must go to elections." This is the third corruption probe in which police have recommended charges against the prime minister. His wife already faces trial in a separate case for allegedly misusing state funds.
