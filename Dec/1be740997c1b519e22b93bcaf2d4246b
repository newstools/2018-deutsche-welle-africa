Ukrainian authorities would allow the martial law to expire on December 26 barring a Russian invasion, President Petro Poroshenko told reporters on Sunday. Last month, Kyiv declared a 30-day martial law order in ten Ukrainian regions after the Russian navy seized three Ukrainian vessels in the Kerch Strait. "Unless there is a large-scale aggression, an intrusion of Russian military forces into Ukrainian territory beyond the line of conflict (with pro-Russian rebels) and the Crimea administrative border, martial law will not be prolonged," Poroshenko said.

Poroshenko is expected to run for re-election in March 2019 but is facing an uphill battle. Some observers speculated that the martial law could serve to postpone the vote.

At the same time, the Ukrainian president refused to confirm his 2019 presidential run. "If I decide to run and then it so happens that someone more worthy appears, I would help him," he told reporters.
