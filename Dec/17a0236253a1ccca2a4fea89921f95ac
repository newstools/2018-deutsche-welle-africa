More than 40 people including children have been hurt in a major explosion at a two-story restaurant in the north of Japan, local police said on Sunday. The incident happened at around 8:30 p.m local time (1130 UTC), according to local media. Most of the 42 injuries were mild but that at least one person was said to be critically hurt, fire officials said. Fires broke out following the incident and images from the scene showed large flames and plumes of smoke rising from the remains of a building in Sapporo, the capital of the northern island of Hokkaido. About 20 fire engines were sent to extinguish the flames, which national broadcaster NHK said took several hours. The Kyodo news agency reported that the strength of the blast had caused a number of nearby buildings to collapse. Eyewitnesses reported smelling gas in the area after the blast, according to the Japan Times. The cause of the explosion is under investigation. Police said they had no other details. mm/rc (AP, dpa)
